Sending the message as an attached file is **crucial**  so necessary Internet headers are included. You must send the message from the inbox of the original recipient.\n\nTo report a phishing message, follow the procedure for reporting spam.\n\n**Issue**\n\n## What is spam?\n\nSpam is unsolicited junk email sent indiscriminately in bulk, often for commercial purposes. Much of it is sent by botnets, networks of virus-infected computers, complicating the process of tracking down the spammers. According to various estimates, about 80% of all email in the world may be spam.\n\n## What is phishing?\n\nPhishing is the practice of defrauding users into giving up their usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Phishing emails will often try to get you to click on links that take you to fake websites. They often pretend to be from organizations such as a bank, PayPal, Amazon, or even TeamDynamix.\n\nNever respond to email asking you to provide personal information.

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

Sending the message as an attached file is **crucial**  so necessary Internet headers are included. You must send the message from the inbox of the original recipient.\n\nTo report a phishing message, follow the procedure for reporting spam.\n\n**Issue**\n\n## What is spam?\n\nSpam is unsolicited junk email sent indiscriminately in bulk, often for commercial purposes. Much of it is sent by botnets, networks of virus-infected computers, complicating the process of tracking down the spammers. According to various estimates, about 80% of all email in the world may be spam.\n\n## What is phishing?\n\nPhishing is the practice of defrauding users into giving up their usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Phishing emails will often try to get you to click on links that take you to fake websites. They often pretend to be from organizations such as a bank, PayPal, Amazon, or even TeamDynamix.\n\nNever respond to email asking you to provide personal information.

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

Sending the message as an attached file is **crucial**  so necessary Internet headers are included. You must send the message from the inbox of the original recipient.\n\nTo report a phishing message, follow the procedure for reporting spam.\n\n**Issue**\n\n## What is spam?\n\nSpam is unsolicited junk email sent indiscriminately in bulk, often for commercial purposes. Much of it is sent by botnets, networks of virus-infected computers, complicating the process of tracking down the spammers. According to various estimates, about 80% of all email in the world may be spam.\n\n## What is phishing?\n\nPhishing is the practice of defrauding users into giving up their usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Phishing emails will often try to get you to click on links that take you to fake websites. They often pretend to be from organizations such as a bank, PayPal, Amazon, or even TeamDynamix.\n\nNever respond to email asking you to provide personal information. TDX will never ask you for personal information by email.\n\n## Steps on forwarding an email as an attachment for several popular email clients and web browsers\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Windows)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , press Ctrl + Alt + F \\--or-- _Highlight or Open  the message_, on the \"Home\" tab under the \"More\" option\nof the \"Respond\" group choose Forward as attachment \\--or-- _Open a new message,  _ drag and drop the message(s) to be forwarded into the\nbody of the new message.\n\n###\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , drag and drop message(s) into the new message window\n\n###\n\n---\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Mac)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , Control+Command+J  ( ^⌘J )\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _ on the **home ribbon  **click on **attachment**\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _on the **Message  **menu select **attachment**\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , **drag and drop  **message(s) into the **new message window**\n\n### Mac OS X Mail\n\n_Highlight message_ , select **Forward as Attachment  **from the menu\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nFurther troubleshooting advice will be provided once the spam or phishing email is received.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

Sending the message as an attached file is **crucial**  so necessary Internet headers are included. You must send the message from the inbox of the original recipient.\n\nTo report a phishing message, follow the procedure for reporting spam.\n\n**Issue**\n\n## What is spam?\n\nSpam is unsolicited junk email sent indiscriminately in bulk, often for commercial purposes. Much of it is sent by botnets, networks of virus-infected computers, complicating the process of tracking down the spammers. According to various estimates, about 80% of all email in the world may be spam.\n\n## What is phishing?\n\nPhishing is the practice of defrauding users into giving up their usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Phishing emails will often try to get you to click on links that take you to fake websites. They often pretend to be from organizations such as a bank, PayPal, Amazon, or even TeamDynamix.\n\nNever respond to email asking you to provide personal information. TDX will never ask you for personal information by email.\n\n## Steps on forwarding an email as an attachment for several popular email clients and web browsers\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Windows)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , press Ctrl + Alt + F \\--or-- _Highlight or Open  the message_, on the \"Home\" tab under the \"More\" option\nof the \"Respond\" group choose Forward as attachment \\--or-- _Open a new message,  _ drag and drop the message(s) to be forwarded into the\nbody of the new message.\n\n###\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , drag and drop message(s) into the new message window\n\n###\n\n---\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Mac)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , Control+Command+J  ( ^⌘J )\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _ on the **home ribbon  **click on **attachment**\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _on the **Message  **menu select **attachment**\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , **drag and drop  **message(s) into the **new message window**\n\n### Mac OS X Mail\n\n_Highlight message_ , select **Forward as Attachment  **from the menu\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nFurther troubleshooting advice will be provided once the spam or phishing email is received.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

Phishing emails will often try to get you to click on links that take you to fake websites.

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

Sending the message as an attached file is **crucial**  so necessary Internet headers are included. You must send the message from the inbox of the original recipient.\n\nTo report a phishing message, follow the procedure for reporting spam.\n\n**Issue**\n\n## What is spam?\n\nSpam is unsolicited junk email sent indiscriminately in bulk, often for commercial purposes. Much of it is sent by botnets, networks of virus-infected computers, complicating the process of tracking down the spammers. According to various estimates, about 80% of all email in the world may be spam.\n\n## What is phishing?\n\nPhishing is the practice of defrauding users into giving up their usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Phishing emails will often try to get you to click on links that take you to fake websites. They often pretend to be from organizations such as a bank, PayPal, Amazon, or even TeamDynamix.\n\nNever respond to email asking you to provide personal information. TDX will never ask you for personal information by email.\n\n## Steps on forwarding an email as an attachment for several popular email clients and web browsers\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Windows)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , press Ctrl + Alt + F \\--or-- _Highlight or Open  the message_, on the \"Home\" tab under the \"More\" option\nof the \"Respond\" group choose Forward as attachment \\--or-- _Open a new message,  _ drag and drop the message(s) to be forwarded into the\nbody of the new message.\n\n###\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , drag and drop message(s) into the new message window\n\n###\n\n---\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Mac)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , Control+Command+J  ( ^⌘J )\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _ on the **home ribbon  **click on **attachment**\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _on the **Message  **menu select **attachment**\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , **drag and drop  **message(s) into the **new message window**\n\n### Mac OS X Mail\n\n_Highlight message_ , select **Forward as Attachment  **from the menu\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nFurther troubleshooting advice will be provided once the spam or phishing email is received.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

Sending the message as an attached file is **crucial**  so necessary Internet headers are included. You must send the message from the inbox of the original recipient.\n\nTo report a phishing message, follow the procedure for reporting spam.\n\n**Issue**\n\n## What is spam?\n\nSpam is unsolicited junk email sent indiscriminately in bulk, often for commercial purposes. Much of it is sent by botnets, networks of virus-infected computers, complicating the process of tracking down the spammers. According to various estimates, about 80% of all email in the world may be spam.\n\n## What is phishing?\n\nPhishing is the practice of defrauding users into giving up their usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Phishing emails will often try to get you to click on links that take you to fake websites. They often pretend to be from organizations such as a bank, PayPal, Amazon, or even TeamDynamix.\n\nNever respond to email asking you to provide personal information. TDX will never ask you for personal information by email.\n\n## Steps on forwarding an email as an attachment for several popular email clients and web browsers\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Windows)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , press Ctrl + Alt + F \\--or-- _Highlight or Open  the message_, on the \"Home\" tab under the \"More\" option\nof the \"Respond\" group choose Forward as attachment \\--or-- _Open a new message,  _ drag and drop the message(s) to be forwarded into the\nbody of the new message.\n\n###\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , drag and drop message(s) into the new message window\n\n###\n\n---\n\n### Microsoft Outlook (Mac)\n\n_Highlight the message_ , Control+Command+J  ( ^⌘J )\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _ on the **home ribbon  **click on **attachment**\n\n\\--or--\n\n_Highlight the message,  _on the **Message  **menu select **attachment**\n\n### Office 365 Outlook Web Access - (OWA)\n\n_Open a new message_ , **drag and drop  **message(s) into the **new message window**\n\n### Mac OS X Mail\n\n_Highlight message_ , select **Forward as Attachment  **from the menu\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nFurther troubleshooting advice will be provided once the spam or phishing email is received.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?

    "extracted": "**Overview**\n\nUp to now you only had a password to protect your account. If someone got hold of your password (an authentication factor), this person could use your username and password to impersonate you. If the system would request a second or third unique factor, taking over your account is a lot harder. There are 3 factors of authentication:\n\n  1. Something you **know** : your password\n  2. Something you **have** : your (smart)phone\n  3. Something you **are** : your fingerprint\n\nAs you can see, with MFA just stealing your password will not be enough to take control of your account.\n\n**Issue**\n\nMicrosoft 365 is currently using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), relying on a password and a phone. In short it can be explained in the following steps:\n\n  1. Your Office 365 account gets enabled for MFA\n  2. Next time you logon to an Microsoft 365 account you need to configure MFA (this requires a web browser)\n  3. You identify the methods of the second authentication. If you have an iPhone or Android we recommend the **Authenticator App**  (see screenshot of the app on an iPhone)\n  4. After you complete configuration, MFA will be invoked each time you connect to an Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\nIf you have a smartphone, we recommend using the **Microsoft Authenticator App**. It makes using Microsoft 365 MFA quick and easy. Install it ahead of time from the:\n\n  * [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458?mt=8)\n  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US)\n\nAlso, when you use your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone, you are truly using 3-factor authentication.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nNeed additional information or assistance?
