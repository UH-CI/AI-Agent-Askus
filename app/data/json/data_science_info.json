Using these data sets to drive discovery presents new issues in researchers' efforts to organize, collaborate and use computational resources on data collected during experiments. Scientific gateways and workflows are tools that can help provide solutions to such issues. Gateways enable users from a specific research domain to develop and use data, tools and applications via a web interface to meet their researching needs. Workflows give users the ability to perform sequential computational tasks on data using computing resources while removing the complexity of setting up cyberinfrastructure and the need for thorough programming knowledge. Together, gateways and workflows foster a collaborative environment for research and scientific reproducibility.\n\nIn this workshop, discussions will include an introduction to scientific gateways and workflows. Attendees will learn how gateways and workflows may benefit their research and about some existing gateways that may be suitable for their scientific interests. For the hands-on portion, attendees will access and use HydroShare, a gateway built for water-resource sciences. Activities will include navigating HydroShare and its available tools and web apps and creating a data resource which can be used for collaboration with others in the scientific community. Attendees will also use an existing workflow to perform computational tasks on some data to demonstrate the ease and benefits of using community-developed tools for data analysis.",
