The next time you log into your Microsoft 365 account, you will be prompted to configure MFA. This setup process requires a web browser.\n3. Identify the method for your second authentication factor. If you have an iPhone or Android device, it is recommended to use the Microsoft Authenticator App.\n4. After completing the configuration, MFA will be required each time you connect to a Microsoft 365 service from a new device.\n\nIf you use a smartphone, consider installing the Microsoft Authenticator App from either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store in advance to simplify the MFA process. Using your fingerprint to unlock the smartphone allows for 3-factor authentication as well. If you need further assistance, contact the ITS Service Center.",
