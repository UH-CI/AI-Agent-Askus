Connect to the Enterprise VPN before accessing the request form.\n5. Use a supported browser, like Google Chrome, for the best experience.\n6. Complete the console access request accurately and promptly after logging in with your UH username and password.\n7.

            "answer": "To enhance security by using 3-factor authentication when accessing Microsoft 365, you can implement the following factors:\n\n1. **Something you know**: This is your UH Username and password. This serves as the first factor of authentication.\n\n2. **Something you have**: This is a device that you possess, such as a smartphone or landline. You would use this device to receive a second factor for authentication, such as a phone call or a text message with a verification code.\n\n3. **Additional factor**: For a third factor, you can consider using a physical token or another device that can provide an additional layer of verification, such as a hardware security key or an authentication app.\n\nBy combining these three factors, you significantly decrease the risk of account compromise, as access requires more than just the username and password. This layered approach helps protect against threats like phishing and credential stuffing, ensuring that even if one factor is compromised, unauthorized access can still be prevented.",
