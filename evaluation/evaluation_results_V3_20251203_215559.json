MFA requires two factors for a successful login: your UH Username and password as the first factor, and a second factor through a registered device, such as your smartphone with the Authenticator App. This additional layer of security significantly decreases the risk of account compromise, as an attacker would need not only your credentials but also access to your device to log in.\n\nMoreover, if you register multiple devices with MFA, you retain alternative authentication options in case one device becomes unavailable, such as losing your smartphone. This capability reduces the chances of being locked out of your account while still providing enhanced protection against unauthorized access.",

Decide which two devices you want to use for authentication.\n3. Set up your first device, which can be a smartphone, landline, non-smartphone cellular phone, or a tablet. Make sure to refer to the specific setup instructions for each device.\n4. Optionally, you can add a second (or more) device for additional security.\n\nIt is recommended to register at least two devices for optimal security.",

            "answer": "To enhance security by using 3-factor authentication when accessing Microsoft 365, you would need to combine multiple authentication factors beyond just the UH Username and password. The first factor is \"something you know,\" which is your UH Login credentials (username and password). \n\nFor the second factor, you could use \"something you have,\" such as a mobile phone to receive a push notification or a code via SMS, or a physical token like a Yubikey. \n\nA third factor could be another device that you possess, allowing for additional redundancy. This setup minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, as even if an attacker obtains your username and password, they would still require access to the additional devices or tokens to successfully authenticate. \n\nIt's important to configure multiple devices for the second and third factors to ensure that you have alternatives in case one device is lost or unavailable.",
