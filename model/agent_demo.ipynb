       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1859'}, page_content='##  Duo Mobile app 4.0 update\\n  *[UH]: University of Hawaii\\n### Overview\\nThe Duo Mobile 4.0 version of the app is a significant update to the user\\ninterface. This update will be released on the following schedule:\\n  * For iOS: October 11 through 18, 2021\\n  * For Android: October 11 through 15, 2021\\nDuo Mobile 4.0 requires\\n  * iOS 13 and up\\n  * Android 8 and up\\nOlder versions of the Duo Mobile app will continue to work.\\n### Summary of changes\\nThe following are some of the changes to the Duo Mobile app in version 4.0.\\n**New Duo Approve screen**\\nIn versions prior to 4.0, the _Approve_ button was on the left and the _Deny_\\nbutton was on the right. In Duo Mobile 4.0, the _Approve_ button has been\\nmoved to the **right** , and the _Deny_ button moved to the **left**. Duo made\\nthis change to follow the industry standard of placing positive actions on the\\nright (move forward in the flow of action), and negative actions on the left\\n(move backward in the flow of action).\\nThe interface has also been somewhat simplified and is now clearer on what you\\nare being asked to approve. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of\\nthe old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Approve screen.\\nThe screen that appears after you approve a Duo Push request has also changed\\nand is now more obvious. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the\\nold 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the screen that appears after\\nyou approve a Duo Push.\\n**New Duo Home Screen**\\nThe Duo Home screen (what you see when you first open the app) has been\\nredesigned. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x\\n(left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Home screen.\\n  * There is no longer an \"Edit\" button for removing accounts\\n  * There is no longer an arrow pointing down for displaying the Duo Mobile-generated passcode. To display the Duo Mobile-generated passcode, simply tap on the **University of Hawaii** box.\\n  \\n**New Duo Fraud screen**\\nWhen a Duo Push request is denied in version 3.x.x of the Duo Mobile app, you\\nare asked if it was a fraudulent login attempt, or if you denied the request\\nby mistake. In Duo Mobile 4.0, this is simplified to a yes/no question of _Was\\nthis a suspicious login?_. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of\\nthe old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Duo Fraud screen.\\n**New Duo Allow Notification screen**\\nIn version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are\\nasked if you want to _Allow Notifications_ with an alert similar to the alert\\nshow on the left side of the below graphic. In Duo Mobile 4.0, you will now\\nsee a brief explanation of why you might want to allow notifications (i.e., to\\nbe able to authenticate from the phone\\'s lock screen), and the prompt has also\\nbeen simplified to an _Allow_ or _Skip_ answer. Please see the below graphic\\nfor a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the\\nAllow Notifications screen.\\n**New Duo Allow Camera screen**\\nIn version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are\\nasked if you wanted to _Allow access to the camera_ with an alert similar to\\nthe alert show on the left side of the below graphic. In Duo Mobile 4.0, you\\nwill now see a brief explanation of why you would want to allow the camera\\n(i.e. to be able to add a Duo MFA account via a QR code). The Duo Mobile app\\nwill only access the camera while scanning a QR code to add an account, and\\nwill never access the device\\'s photos. Please see the below graphic for a\\ncomparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Allow\\nCamera screen.\\n**New Android Notification screen**\\nIn Android notifications received in versions prior to 4.0, the word _Approve_\\nwas on the left and _Deny_ was on the right. In Duo Mobile 4.0, the word\\n_Approve_ has been moved to the **right** , and _Deny_ moved to the **left**.\\nDuo made this change to follow the industry standard of placing positive\\nactions on the right (move forward in the flow of action), and negative\\nactions on the left (move backward in the flow of action). The notification\\nhas also been modified to be clearer as to what you are being asked to\\napprove; for example, the _UH Login MFA Device Registration_. Please see the\\nbelow graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right)\\nversions of the Android notification screen.\\n  *[UH]: University of Hawaii')]"
