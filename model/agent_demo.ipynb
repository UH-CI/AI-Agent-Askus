       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1859'}, page_content='##  Duo Mobile app 4.0 update\\n### Overview\\nThe Duo Mobile 4.0 version of the app is a significant update to the user\\ninterface. This update will be released on the following schedule:\\n  * For iOS: October 11 through 18, 2021\\n  * For Android: October 11 through 15, 2021\\nDuo Mobile 4.0 requires\\n  * iOS 13 and up\\n  * Android 8 and up\\nOlder versions of the Duo Mobile app will continue to work.\\n### Summary of changes\\nThe following are some of the changes to the Duo Mobile app in version 4.0.\\n**New Duo Approve screen**\\nIn versions prior to 4.0, the _Approve_ button was on the left and the _Deny_\\nbutton was on the right. In Duo Mobile 4.0, the _Approve_ button has been\\nmoved to the **right** , and the _Deny_ button moved to the **left**. Duo made\\nthis change to follow the industry standard of placing positive actions on the\\nright (move forward in the flow of action), and negative actions on the left\\n(move backward in the flow of action).\\nThe interface has also been somewhat simplified and is now clearer on what you\\nare being asked to approve. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of\\nthe old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Approve screen.\\nThe screen that appears after you approve a Duo Push request has also changed\\nand is now more obvious. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the\\nold 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the screen that appears after\\nyou approve a Duo Push.\\n**New Duo Home Screen**\\nThe Duo Home screen (what you see when you first open the app) has been\\nredesigned. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x\\n(left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Home screen.\\n  * There is no longer an \"Edit\" button for removing accounts\\n  * There is no longer an arrow pointing down for displaying the Duo Mobile-generated passcode. To display the Duo Mobile-generated passcode, simply tap on the **University of Hawaii** box.\\n  \\n**New Duo Fraud screen**\\nWhen a Duo Push request is denied in version 3.x.x of the Duo Mobile app, you\\nare asked if it was a fraudulent login attempt, or if you denied the request\\nby mistake. In Duo Mobile 4.0, this is simplified to a yes/no question of _Was\\nthis a suspicious login?_. Please see the below graphic for a comparison of\\nthe old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Duo Fraud screen.\\n**New Duo Allow Notification screen**\\nIn version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are\\nasked if you want to _Allow Notifications_ with an alert similar to the alert\\nshow on the left side of the below graphic. In Duo Mobile 4.0, you will now\\nsee a brief explanation of why you might want to allow notifications (i.e., to\\nbe able to authenticate from the phone\\'s lock screen), and the prompt has also\\nbeen simplified to an _Allow_ or _Skip_ answer. Please see the below graphic\\nfor a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the\\nAllow Notifications screen.\\n**New Duo Allow Camera screen**\\nIn version 3.x.x of Duo Mobile, when first setting up Duo Mobile, you are\\nasked if you wanted to _Allow access to the camera_ with an alert similar to\\nthe alert show on the left side of the below graphic. In Duo Mobile 4.0, you\\nwill now see a brief explanation of why you would want to allow the camera\\n(i.e. to be able to add a Duo MFA account via a QR code). The Duo Mobile app\\nwill only access the camera while scanning a QR code to add an account, and\\nwill never access the device\\'s photos. Please see the below graphic for a\\ncomparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right) versions of the Allow\\nCamera screen.\\n**New Android Notification screen**\\nIn Android notifications received in versions prior to 4.0, the word _Approve_\\nwas on the left and _Deny_ was on the right. In Duo Mobile 4.0, the word\\n_Approve_ has been moved to the **right** , and _Deny_ moved to the **left**.\\nDuo made this change to follow the industry standard of placing positive\\nactions on the right (move forward in the flow of action), and negative\\nactions on the left (move backward in the flow of action). The notification\\nhas also been modified to be clearer as to what you are being asked to\\napprove; for example, the _UH Login MFA Device Registration_. Please see the\\nbelow graphic for a comparison of the old 3.x.x (left) and new 4.0 (right)\\nversions of the Android notification screen.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1894'}, page_content='##  Traveling with Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\\n### Plan Ahead\\nThere are [many options](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1679) to authenticate\\nwith Duo MFA and several of them will still function even if you find yourself\\nwithout cell service or a stable network connection on your travels. However,\\nit\\'s important to consider the conditions you might encounter on your travels\\nthat may impact how you authenticate. Planning ahead and understanding whether\\nor not you may need to add devices or change how you authenticate _before_ you\\nboard your flight will help ensure you\\'re prepared and able to log in, no\\nmatter what.\\n**Try to answer these key questions before traveling and as you continue to\\nread below:**\\n  * Which second factor devices will you have access to during your travels? \\n    * Will you have access to a smartphone or tablet?\\n    * Will you have access to a (non-smart) cellphone?\\n    * Will you have access to a landline?\\n    * Do you have a hard token?\\n  * Will you have access to cellular service, mobile data, or WiFi?\\n  * Are you traveling to a country subject to export controls?\\n**Short on time? Check out our quick reference guide:**[**The ABCs of\\nTraveling with Duo\\nMFA**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K5cytqd4EmDh8nNxP6SA_Eo7cLzE6xyEJbNhzmpP4H0/edit?usp=sharing)**.**\\n### Select Appropriate MFA Method(s)\\nIt is important to understand which authentication methods will work for you\\nand under what circumstances before you travel. If the device or\\nauthentication method that you normally use will not work during your travels,\\nyou will need to add a different authentication method ahead of time.\\nFor instructions on adding any of the authentication methods below for use\\nwith your Duo MFA, please see our [Adding\\nDevices](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1681) article.\\nFor instructions on how to use any of the below methods to authenticate when\\nlogging in, please see our [Logging in with\\nMFA](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1765) article.\\n####  If you will have access to a smartphone or tablet:\\n  * OPTION 1: Use the Duo Mobile app to send a push to your smartphone or tablet. **Requires mobile data or WiFi.**\\n  * OPTION 2: Use the Duo Mobile app to generate a passcode. **Does not require mobile data or WiFi** , will work even when completely offline.\\n  * OPTION 3: Send yourself passcodes via SMS. Passcodes are sent in batches of ten (10) and you can use the passcodes in sequence to authenticate (once per passcode). **Cell service is required** to receive the SMS with the passcodes, but the ten (10) passcodes can be referenced and used even if you subsequently lose reception or service.\\n  * OPTION 4: Receive a phone call to your cellphone. Press \\'1\\' when prompted to approve your authentication. **Cell service or WiFi calling is required** to receive phone calls.\\n#### If you will have access to a (non-smart) cellphone:\\n  * OPTION 1: Send yourself passcodes via SMS. Passcodes are sent in batches of ten (10) and you can use the passcodes in sequence to authenticate (once per passcode). **Cell service is required** to receive the SMS with the passcodes, but the ten (10) passcodes can be referenced and used even if you subsequently lose reception or service.\\n  * OPTION 2: Receive a phone call to your cellphone. Press \\'1\\' when prompted to approve your authentication. **Cell service is required** to receive phone calls.\\n#### If you will have access to a landline:\\n  * OPTION 1: Receive a phone call to your landline. Press \\'1\\' when prompted to approve your authentication. **Requires telephone service**.\\n#### If you will have access to a hard token:\\n  * OPTION 1: Plug your hard token into a USB port on your laptop/computer, and press the button on the hard token when prompted to authenticate.\\n### General Recommendations\\n#### Use the Duo Mobile app**  \\n**\\nIt is highly recommended to setup and use the Duo Mobile app if you will have\\naccess to a smartphone or tablet during your travels. The Duo Mobile app\\nallows you to authenticate via push notifications if you have access to mobile\\ndata or WiFi. The Duo Mobile app also allows you to generate and use passcodes\\neven if you find yourself completely offline!\\n#### Add multiple devices\\nIt is recommended to add an additional device. Should your primary\\nauthentication device be lost or stolen, you may find yourself unable to\\nlogin.\\n#### Send yourself a batch of SMS passcodes before you leave\\nRegardless of what method you ultimately choose for your travels, it is\\nrecommended to send yourself a batch of SMS passcodes before you leave. These\\npasscodes can be accessed and used in sequence even if you do not have mobile\\ndata, WiFi, or reception. They can also be written or copied to another medium\\nfor use if you don\\'t have access to your phone. Please remember to keep your\\npasscodes secure! See our [Logging in with\\nMFA](https://www.hawaii.edu/askus/1765#smstext) article for instruction on how\\nto send yourself a batch of SMS passcodes.\\n### Traveling to Export Controlled Countries?\\nThe following countries and regions are under sanctions by the [U.S. Office of\\nForeign Assets Control (OFAC)](https://ofac.treasury.gov/) and all Duo\\nauthentication methods (Duo Mobile, Duo passcodes and SMS passciodes, phone\\ncalls, and hard tokens) will not function as they are\\n[blocked](https://help.duo.com/s/article/7544?language=en_US) within their\\nborders.\\n  * Cuba (CU)\\n  * North Korea - Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea (KP)\\n  * Iran (IR)\\n  * Sudan (SD)\\n  * Syria (SY)\\n  * Crimea region (43)\\n  * Donetsk region (14)\\n  * Luhansk region (09)\\n  * Sevastopol region (40)\\nPlease contact the [ITS Help Desk](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/) if\\nyou are planning to travel to any these countries or regions. If you are\\ntraveling to these countries or regions, you are required to uninstall the Duo\\nMobile app from any devices you will be taking with you and are prohibited\\nfrom traveling with hard tokens. All authentications from these embargoed\\ndestinations will result in an \"Access denied. Duo Security does not provide\\nservices in your current location.\" message.\\n### Trouble Logging in When Traveling?\\nIf you\\'re having any difficulty logging in when traveling, please contact the\\n[ITS Help Desk](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/help-desk/).
