As long as your mobile device has mobile network or wi-fi service, authentication requests can be pushed to your device via the Duo Mobile app.  You can download the Duo Mobile app to an iOS or Android device that meets the minimum requirements.\\n\\niOS\\nPlease see\\xa0https://guide.duo.com/iphone\\xa0for the supported version of iOS\\n\\nAndroid\\nPlease see\\xa0https://guide.duo.com/android\\xa0for the supported version of Android\\n\\nOnce you have downloaded the Duo Mobile app and registered your mobile device, authentication requests will be \"pushed\" to your device through the Duo Mobile app.  You would then open the Duo Mobile app and tap on \"Approve\" or \"Deny\" to approve or deny the authentication request.\\nDuo Passcode via the Duo Mobile App\\nThe Duo Mobile app can be used to generate a passcode that can be used to login. Passcodes can be generated without requiring internet access, and can be used even if your mobile device is in airplane mode or otherwise not connected to a WiFi or mobile network with internet access. This is a great option to use when traveling or when in areas where access to the internet might not be guaranteed.\\nPhone Call\\nYou can opt to authenticate via a phone call to a landline or mobile phone.  When it\\'s time to authenticate, you will receive a call on your registered phone number.  You would then push \"1\" on your phone\\'s keypad to authenticate, or push \"9\" to deny the authentication request.\\nRegarding phone numbers beginning with \"+86\"\\nITS has been informed by Duo that due to recent telephony restrictions by the Chinese government, Duo is no longer able to authenticate by phone calls to users with +86 numbers.  If you have a +86 phone number registered in Duo, you will see the following notice:\\n\\xa0\\nOther methods, such as Duo Push, SMS passcodes, or hard tokens will still work.  For more information, please refer to the following Duo knowledgebase article:\\nhttps://help.duo.com/s/article/5001\\nSMS Passcodes\\nIf you do not have a smartphone, but you have a mobile phone with SMS/text messaging capabilities, you can use SMS passcodes to authenticate. When requested, a set of 10 passcodes will be sent to you as a text (SMS) message to your phone.  Each time you authenticate, you would use the next passcode in the sequence. After you\\'ve used all 10 passcodes, you can request a new set of 10 passcodes. You can also request a new set of 10 passcodes at any time. After you\\'ve requested a set of 10 passcodes, you can continue to use all of the passcodes in succession to authenticate even if your mobile device is no longer connected to mobile network.\\nYubikey Hard Token\\nA hard token (sometimes called an authentication or security token) is a hardware security device that is used to authorize a user.  UH provides Yubikey hard tokens for purchase.  The UH hard token is a usb device and must be inserted into your usb port to be used.  You would then touch the hard token anytime you wanted to authenticate.  If you do not have an available usb port, you cannot authenticate with the UH hard token. Hard tokens are not recommended and should be purchased only if you cannot use any of the other above means for authenticating.\\nFor information on purchasing a UH hard token, please visit https://www.hawaii.edu/sitelic/tokens/\\n'),\n",
