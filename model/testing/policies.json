Purpose\n\nTo provide guidance on the appropriate accounting treatment for capital\n(financing) leases and operating leases when the University is the lessee.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. Lease \u2013 A Lease is a contractual agreement calling for the lessee (user) to\npay the lessor (owner) for the use of an asset. Property, buildings, business\nor industrial equipment and vehicles are common assets that are leased.  \n  \nB. Operating Lease \u2013 An Operating Lease is a Lease whose term is short\ncompared to the useful life of the asset being leased.  \n  \nC. Capital Lease \u2013 A Capital Lease is a type of Lease in which a finance\ncompany is typically the legal owner of the asset during the duration of the\nLease, while the lessee not just has operating control over the asset, but\nalso has a substantial share of the economic risks and returns from the change\nin the valuation of the underlying asset. A Lease is considered to be a\nCapital Lease if one or more of the following criteria is met:  \n  \n\\- The Lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of\nthe Lease Term  \n  \n\\- The Lease contains a Bargain Purchase Option  \n  \n\\- The Lease Term is equal to 75% or more of the estimated economic life of\nthe leased property. However, if the beginning of the Lease Term falls within\nthe last 25% of the total estimated economic life of the leased property\nincluding earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes\nof classifying the Lease.Residual Value of Leased Asset  \n  \n\\- The present value of the Minimum Lease Payments, excluding that portion of\nthe payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and\ntaxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or\nexceeds 90% of the excess of the Fair Value of the Leased Property to the\nlessor.  \n  \nD. Bargain Purchase Option \u2013 A provision allowing the lessee, at his option,\nto purchase the leased property for a price which is sufficiently lower than\nthe expected fair (market) value of the property at the date the option\nbecomes exercisable, that exercise of the option appears, at the inception of\nthe Lease, to be reasonably assured.  \n  \nE. Residual Value of Leased Asset \u2013 The estimated fair (market) value of the\nleased (asset) at the end of the Lease Term.  \n  \nF. Fair (Market) Value of the Leased Property \u2013 The price for which the\nproperty could be sold in an arm\u2019s length transaction between unrelated\nparties.  \n  \nG. Interest Rate Implicit in the Lease \u2013 This is the discount rate that, when\napplied to the Minimum Lease Payments and any unguaranteed residual value\naccruing to the lessor, causes the aggregate present value to equal the Fair\nValue of the Leased Property to the lessor.  \n  \nH. Lease Term \u2013 The fixed term of the Lease in months.  \n  \nI. Lessee\u2019s Incremental Borrowing Rate \u2013 This is the rate that, at the\ninception of the Lease, the lessee would have incurred to borrow over a\nsimilar term the funds necessary to purchase the leased asset.  \n  \nJ. Minimum Lease Payments \u2013 From the standpoint of the lessee: The payments\nthat the lessee is obligated to make or can be required to make in connection\nwith the leased property. However, a guarantee by the lessee of the lessor\u2019s\ndebt and the lessee\u2019s obligation to pay (apart from the rental payments)\nexecutory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes in connection with\nthe leased property shall be excluded. If the Lease contains a Bargain\nPurchase Option, only the minimum rental payments over the Lease Term and the\npayment called for by the Bargain Purchase Option shall be included in the\nMinimum Lease Payments. Otherwise, Minimum Lease Payments include the\nfollowing:  \n  \n\\- The minimum rental payments over the Lease Term  \n  \n\\- Any guarantee by the lessee of the Residual Value of the Leased Asset at\nthe expiration of the Lease Term, whether or not payment of the guarantee\nconstitutes a purchase of the leased property  \n  \n\\- Any payment for failure to renew or extend the Lease at the expiration of\nthe Lease Term  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nFiscal Administrators (FA) are responsible for analyzing Lease agreements and\ndetermining whether the Lease is an Operating Lease or a Capital Lease.  \n  \nA. Operating Lease  \n  \nThe Operating Lease covers the rental of an asset from a lessor. The asset is\nnot recorded on the University\u2019s balance sheet and monthly payments are\nrecorded as rental expense.  \n  \nLease rent payments should be coded using appropriate object codes:  \n  \n5600 RENT \u2013 EQUIPMENT OTHER  \n5605 RENT \u2013 EQUIP, DATA PROCESSING  \n5610 RENT \u2013 EQUIP, OTHER OFF  \n  \nB. Capital Lease  \n  \nThe accounting for a Capital Lease involves recording the acquisition of the\nasset and the recording of the corresponding Lease payment obligation on the\nUniversity\u2019s balance sheet.  \n  \n1\\. The lessee shall record a Capital Lease as an asset and an obligation at\nan amount equal to the present value of the Minimum Lease Payments using his\nincremental borrowing rate, unless it is practicable for him to learn the\nInterest Rate Implicit in the Lease and the implicit rate is less than the\nLessee\u2019s Incremental Borrowing Rate. However, if the amount exceeds the Fair\nValue of the Leased Property at the inception of the Lease, the amount\nrecorded as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value.  \n  \n2\\. The capitalized leased asset should be amortized over the term of the\nLease if the term is shorter than the useful life of the asset, unless the\nLease provided for transfer of title or includes a Bargain Purchase Option.  \n  \n3\\. During the term of the Lease, each minimum Lease payment shall be\nallocated between a reduction of the obligation and interest expense so as to\nproduce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the\nLease obligation.  \n  \n4\\. When leasing land, the Lease is classified as an Operating Lease unless it\nprovides for transfer of title or includes a Bargain Purchase Option.  \n  \n5\\. FA responsibilities:  \n  \na.

Purpose\n\nA. PURPOSE:  \n  \nDescription of the procedures, considerations, and requirements associated\nwith the conduct of an inquiry and assessment in response to allegations of\nresearch and scholarly misconduct.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. Allegation means a disclosure of possible research misconduct through any\nmeans of communication. The disclosure may be by written or oral statement or\nother communication to the RIO or other institutional official such as an\nEthics Committee member, or Departmental Chairs or Deans.  \n  \nB. Assessment means the initial evaluation of an allegation of research\nmisconduct by the Research Integrity Officer and Ethic Committee Chairperson.\nDuring this time it will be determined whether the allegation is sufficiently\ncredible and specific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be\nidentified.  \n  \nC. Complainant means a person who makes an allegation of research misconduct.  \n  \nD. Conflict of Interest means the real or apparent interference of one\nperson\u2019s interests with the interests of another person where the\ndisinterestedness of an adjudicator may reasonably be called into question and\npotential bias may occur due to prior or existing personal or professional\nrelationships. As expressed in Executive Policy EP 12.214, a potential or\nactual conflict of interest exists when commitments and obligations to the\nUniversity or to widely recognized professional norms are likely to be\ncompromised by a person\u2019s other interests or commitments, especially\nfinancial, particularly if those interests or commitments are not disclosed.  \n  \nE. Deciding Official (DO) means a Senior Academic or Research Institutional\nOfficial appointed by the University President. This individual makes final\ndeterminations on allegations of research misconduct and any institutional\nadministrative action. The DO will not be the same individual as the Research\nIntegrity Officer and should have no direct prior involvement in the\ninstitution's inquiry, investigation, or allegation assessment. A Deciding\nOfficial\u2019s appointment of individuals to evaluate allegations of research\nmisconduct is not considered to be direct prior involvement on the part of the\nDO.  \n  \nF. Ethics Committee (EC) means the standing committee appointed by the DO and\nestablished to assist the RIO in evaluating alleged violations of research\nmisconduct. The Ethics Committee shall have 16 members consisting of a\nChairperson and 15 members selected from faculty and staff within the UH\nsystem.  \n  \nG. Evidence means any document, tangible item, or testimony offered or\nobtained during a research misconduct proceeding that tends to prove or\ndisprove the existence of an alleged fact.  \n  \n1\\. Burden of Proof. The University has the burden of proof for making a\nfinding of research misconduct. The destruction, absence of, or respondent\u2019s\nfailure to provide research records adequately documenting the questioned\nresearch is evidence of misconduct where the University has established by a\npreponderance of evidence that the respondent intentionally, knowingly, or\nrecklessly had research records and destroyed them, had the opportunity to\nmaintain the records but did not do so, or maintained the records and failed\nto produce them in a timely manner and that the respondent\u2019s conduct\nconstitutes a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant\nresearch community.  \n  \n2\\. Preponderance of evidence means proof by information that, compared with\nthat opposing it, leads to the conclusion that the fact at issue is more\nprobably true than not.  \n  \n3\\. Standard of Proof. An UH finding of research misconduct must be proved by\na preponderance of the evidence.  \n  \nH. General Counsel means the legal counsel who represents the University and\nis responsible for advising the DO, RIO, and Ethics Committee whenever such\ncounsel is sought. The UH General counsel does not represent the respondent,\nthe complainant/informant, or any other person participating during the\nInquiry or Investigation stages, or any follow-up action, except the\nInstitutional officials, EC members, and others responsible for managing or\nconducting the University of Hawaii\u2019s evaluations of research misconduct\nallegations as part of their official duties.  \n  \nI. Good Faith, as applied to a complainant or witness, means having a belief\nin the truth of one\u2019s allegation or testimony such that a reasonable person\nwould call attention to the perceived irregularities known at the time. An\nallegation, testimony, or cooperation on the part of a complainant, informant,\nwitness, or respondent is not in good faith if it is made with knowing or\nreckless disregard for information that would negate the allegation or\ntestimony. Good faith as applied to members of a committee or review panel\nmeans cooperation for the purpose of helping an institution meet its\nresponsibilities to investigate potential research misconduct.  \n  \nJ. HHS means the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  \n  \nK. Informant means a person who wishes to remain anonymous and who informs the\nUniversity (e.g., through the Ethics Committee, the RIO, an institutional\nofficial) of the possibility of research misconduct.  \n  \nL. Inquiry means preliminary information-gathering and fact-finding to\ndetermine whether an allegation of research or scholarly misconduct warrants\nan investigation.  \n  \nM. Institutional Member means a person who is employed by, is an agent of, or\nis affiliated by contract or agreement with an institution. Institutional\nmembers may include, but are not limited to officials, tenured and untenured\nfaculty, teaching and support staff, researchers, research coordinators,\nclinical technicians, postdoctoral and other fellows, students, volunteers,\nagents, and contractors, subcontractors, and sub- awardees, and their\nemployees.  \n  \nN. Investigation means the formal development of a factual record and the\nexamination of that record by an EC Review Panel, leading to a decision not to\nmake a recommendation of a charge of research misconduct or to recommend such\na charge. Decisions are reported in writing to the DO.  \n  \nO. Institutional Investigation means the Institution\u2019s (e.g., DO and\nAdministrators) evaluation of the EC investigation, for the purpose of either\nconcurring with the EC\u2019s findings or initiating ancillary procedures, such as\nadditional interviews and/or further investigation.  \n  \nP. Misconduct Definition (PHS). For the purposes of PHS regulations and\nreporting to the Office of Research Integrity, \u201cMisconduct\u201d or \u201cResearch\nMisconduct\u201d means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing,\nperforming, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.  \n  \n1\\. Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.  \n  \n2\\. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes,\nor changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not\naccurately represented in the research record.  \n  \n3\\. Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person\u2019s ideas, processes,\nresults, or words without giving appropriate credit.  \n  \nResearch Misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.  \n  \n  \nQ. Misconduct Definition (UH). Under Executive Policy EP 12.211, the UH\ndefinition of misconduct includes the PHS definition and the following\nelements:  \n  \n1\\. Abuse of confidentiality. Taking or appropriating confidential or private\ninformation without proper authority or releasing or disclosing to others,\nwithout proper authority, ideas, data, or other information given with the\nexpectation of confidentiality. This includes any unauthorized disclosure of\npersonal health information as defined by HIPAA in the context of research\nmisconduct.  \n  \n2\\. Property Violation. Misappropriation, maliciously destroying, or altering\nwithout proper authority the research-related papers, data, supplies,\nequipment, or other products of research or scholarship. \u201cProperty\u201d in this\ncontext can be regarded as either physical or intellectual property.  \n  \n3\\. Improprieties of Authorship: Improper assignment of credit, such as\nexcluding others, misrepresentation of the same material as original in more\nthan one publication; listing as an author any persons who (i) did not\ncontribute significantly to the published research, (ii) do not or cannot\nstand behind the research results or (iii) have not carefully examined the\nmanuscript. Improprieties also include allowing oneself to be listed as an\nauthor when significant contributions have not been made and submission of\nmulti-authored publications without the concurrence of all authors.  \n  \n4\\. Misappropriation of Funds. Using research, or scholarship-related, funds\nfor purposes that are in clear and substantial violation of the terms of a\ngrant or regulations and policies  \n  \n5\\. Violation of generally accepted research practices. Serious deviation from\naccepted practices in proposing or carrying out research, improper\nmanipulation of experiments to obtain biased results, deceptive statistical or\nanalytical manipulations, or improper reporting of results.  \n  \n6\\. Material failure to comply with federal, state, or university regulations\npertaining to care and protection of animal subjects; protection of human\nsubjects; use of recombinant DNA, radioactive, biological, or chemical\nmaterials; or the conduct of classified research. This includes but is not\nlimited to serious or substantial willful violations that involve\ninappropriate use of funds.  \n  \n7\\. Inappropriate behavior including accusations of misconduct made in bad\nfaith, withholding or destruction of information relevant to a claim of\nmisconduct, reckless or false testimony to an Ethics Committee or Review Panel\nmember, and retaliation against persons involved in an investigation.  \n  \n8\\. Deliberate material misrepresentation of qualifications, experience, or\nresearch accomplishments to advance a research program, to obtain external\nfunding, or for other professional advancement.  \n  \n9\\. Conduct that violates research and scholarly-related ethical standards as\nexpressed in relevant codes of conduct promulgated by professional\nassociations and learned societies within the various disciplines.  \n  \n10\\. Violations of provisions of Executive Policy EP 12.214 regarding conflict\nof interest.  \n  \nR. Office of Research Integrity (ORI) means the office to which the HHS\nSecretary has delegated responsibility for addressing research integrity and\nmisconduct issues related to PHS supported activities.i (website:\nhttp://ori.dhhs.gov/ )  \n  \nS. PHS support means PHS funding for biomedical or behavioral research,\nbiomedical or behavioral research training, or activities related to that\nresearch, or training that may be provided through: PHS grants, cooperative\nagreements, or contracts or sub- grants or subcontracts under those PHS\nfunding instruments; or salary or other payments under PHS grants, cooperative\nagreements or contracts.  \n  \nT. Public Health Service or PHS means the unit within HHS that includes the\nOffice of Public Health and Science and the following Operating Divisions:\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Agency for Toxic Substances and\nDisease Registry, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug\nAdministration, Health Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health\nService, National Institutes of Health, and the Substance Abuse and Mental\nHealth Services Administration, and the offices of the Regional Health\nAdministrators.  \n  \nU. Records of Research Misconduct Proceedings means: (1) the research records\nand evidence secured for the research misconduct proceeding pursuant to this\npolicy and 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 93.305, 93.307(b), and 93.310(d), except to the extent\nthe RIO determines and documents that those records are not relevant to the\nproceeding or that the records duplicate other records that have been\nretained; (2) the documentation of the determination of irrelevant or\nduplicate records; (3) the inquiry report and final documents (not drafts)\nproduced in the course of preparing that report, including the documentation\nof any decision not to investigate, as required by 42 CFR \u00a7 93.309(c); (4) the\ninvestigation report and all records (other than drafts of the report) in\nsupport of the report, including the recordings or transcripts of each\ninterview conducted; and (5) the complete record of any appeal within the\ninstitution from the finding of research misconduct.  \n  \nV. Research Integrity Officer (RIO) is appointed by the DO or his/her\ndesignee. The RIO, in consultation with the Chairperson of the Ethics\nCommittee, is responsible for: (1) assessing allegations of research\nmisconduct to determine if they fall within the definition of research\nmisconduct, as covered by Executive Policy EP 12.211 and whether they warrant\nan inquiry on the basis of the allegation being sufficiently credible and\nspecific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be identified;\n(2) overseeing inquiries and investigations; and (3) providing staff support\nto Review Panels.  \n  \nW. Research Misconduct Proceeding means any actions related to alleged\nresearch misconduct that is within 42 CFR Part 93 and EP 12.211, including but\nnot limited to, allegation assessments, inquiries, investigations, ORI\noversight reviews, hearings and administrative appeals.  \n  \nX. Research Record means the record of data (both written and electronic) or\nresults that embody the facts resulting from academic research or scholarly\nwork, including but not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records,\nprogress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports,\njournal articles, and any documents and materials provided to the RIO, an EC\nmember, or an institutional official during the course of a research\nmisconduct proceeding.ii  \n  \nY. Respondent means the person against whom an allegation of research\nmisconduct is directed and who is the subject of a research misconduct\nproceeding.  \n  \nZ. Retaliation means an adverse action taken against a complainant, informant,\nwitness, or EC Committee or Panel member of this institution or one of its\ninstitutional members in response to (1) a good faith allegation of research\nmisconduct; or (2) good faith cooperation with a research misconduct\nproceeding.  \n  \nAA. Review Panel means the group of faculty and staff that conducts an inquiry\nor investigation dealing with allegations of research misconduct. The Review\nPanel shall be composed of five (5) individuals. The RIO, in consultation with\nthe EC Chairperson, will appoint the Review Panel members who may include non-\nEC members who have relevant expertise.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Conducting the Assessment and Inquiry  \n  \n1\\. Assessment of Allegations.  \n  \nUpon receiving an allegation of research misconduct, the RIO, in consultation\nwith the Ethics Committee Chairperson will immediately assess the allegation\nto determine whether 1) it is sufficiently credible, 2) it is sufficiently\nspecific so that potential evidence of research misconduct may be identified,\n3) it is within the jurisdictional criteria of 42 CFR \u00a7 93.102, and 4) it\nfalls within the definition of research misconduct in this policy or 42 CFR \u00a7\n93.103. An inquiry must be conducted if these criteria are met. Allegations\ndeemed to be without substance will not be moved to the Inquiry stage.  \n  \nThe assessment period should be brief, preferably concluded within a week. In\nconducting the assessment, the RIO need not interview the complainant,\ninformant, respondent, or other witnesses, or gather data beyond any that may\nhave been submitted with the allegation, except as necessary to determine\nwhether the allegation is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential\nevidence of research misconduct may be identified.  \n  \n2\\. Initiation and Purpose of the Inquiry.  \n  \nIf the RIO, in consultation with the Chair of the Ethics Committee, determines\nthat the criteria for an inquiry are met, he or she will immediately initiate\nthe inquiry process. The purpose of the inquiry is to conduct an initial\nreview of the available evidence to determine whether to conduct an\ninvestigation. An inquiry does not require a full review of all the evidence\nrelated to the allegation.  \n  \n3\\. Notice to Respondent, Sequestration of Research Records.  \n  \nBefore beginning or during an inquiry, the RIO must make a good faith effort\nto notify the respondent in writing, if the respondent is known. If the\ninquiry subsequently identifies additional respondents, they must be notified\nin writing. On or before the time at which the respondent is notified, the RIO\nmust take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all the\nresearch records and evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct\nproceeding, inventory the records and evidence and sequester them in a secure\nmanner, except that where the research records or evidence encompass\nscientific instruments shared by a number of users, custody may be limited to\ncopies of the data or evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies\nare substantially equivalent to the evidentiary value of the instruments\n(42CFR \u00a793.307(b)). The RIO may consult with ORI for advice and assistance in\nthis regard.  \n  \n4\\. Appointment of the Inquiry Panel.  \n  \nThe RIO, in consultation with the Chairperson of the Ethics Committee and\nother institutional officials as appropriate, will appoint an inquiry panel\nand panel chair within 10 days of the decision to conduct an inquiry or as\nsoon thereafter as practical. The inquiry panel must consist of individuals\nwho do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial conflicts of\ninterest with those involved and should include individuals with the\nappropriate subject expertise to evaluate the evidence and issues related to\nthe allegation, interview the principal and key witnesses, and conduct the\ninquiry.  \n  \n5\\. Instructions to the Panel and First Meeting.  \n  \nThe RIO, in consultation with the Chairperson of the Ethics Committee, will\nprepare instructions for the inquiry panel that:  \n  \na. Sets forth the time for completion of the inquiry;  \n  \nb. Describes the allegations and any related issues identified during the\nallegation assessment;  \n  \nc. States that the purpose of the inquiry is preliminary information gathering\nand fact-finding to determine whether an allegation of research or scientific\nmisconduct warrants an investigation;  \n  \nd. States that an investigation is warranted if the panel determines: (1)\nthere is a reasonable basis for concluding that the allegation falls within\nthe definition of research misconduct and is within the jurisdictional\ncriteria of 42 CFR \u00a7 93.102(a), or EP 12.211; and (2) the allegation has\nsubstance, based on the panel\u2019s review during the inquiry;  \n  \ne. Informs the inquiry panel that they are responsible for preparing or\ndirecting the preparation of a written report of the inquiry that meets the\nrequirements of this policy and 42 CFR \u00a7 93.309(a).  \n  \nAt the panel\u2019s first meeting, the RIO will review the instructions to the\npanel, discuss the allegations, any related issues, and the appropriate\nprocedures for conducting the inquiry, assist the panel with organizing plans\nfor the inquiry, and answer any questions raised by the panel. The RIO will be\npresent or available throughout the inquiry to advise the panel as needed and\nto provide staff support to the panel.  \n  \n6\\. Inquiry Process.  \n  \nThe inquiry panel will interview the complainant, the respondent, and key\nwitnesses as well as examine relevant research records and materials. The\ninquiry panel will evaluate the evidence, including the testimony obtained\nduring the inquiry, and will decide whether an investigation is warranted\nbased on the criteria in this policy and 42 CFR \u00a7 93.307(d). When an\ninvestigation is warranted the panel will notify the RIO, and get consultation\non the subsequent course of action following the inquiry. The scope of the\ninquiry is not required to decide, and does not normally include deciding,\nwhether misconduct definitely occurred, determining definitely who committed\nthe research misconduct or conducting exhaustive interviews and analyses.\nHowever, if a legally sufficient admission of research misconduct is made by\nthe respondent, misconduct may be determined at the inquiry stage if all\nrelevant issues are resolved (See Section III (D)(3) of EP 12.211). If an\nadmission is affirmed in a case involving PHS funds the institution shall\npromptly consult with ORI to determine the next steps that should be taken.  \n  \n7\\. Time for Completion.  \n  \nThe inquiry, including preparation of the final inquiry report and the\ndecision of the DO on whether an investigation is warranted, must be completed\nwithin 60 calendar days of initiation of the inquiry, unless the RIO\ndetermines that circumstances clearly warrant a longer period. If the RIO\napproves an extension, the inquiry record must include documentation of the\nreasons for exceeding the 60-day period. The respondent will be notified of\nthe extension.  \n  \n  \nB. The Inquiry Report  \n  \n1\\. Elements of the Inquiry Report.  \n  \nA written inquiry report must be prepared that includes the following\ninformation: (1) the name and position of the respondent; (2) a description of\nthe allegations of research misconduct; (3) the funding support, including for\nexample, grant numbers, grant applications, contracts and publications listing\nfunding support; (4) the basis for recommending or not recommending that the\nallegations warrant an investigation; (5) any comments on the draft report by\nthe respondent or complainant.xi  \n  \nThe inquiry report should also include: the names and titles of the panel\nmembers who conducted the inquiry; their signatures; a summary of the inquiry\nprocess used; a list of the research records reviewed; summaries of any\ninterviews; and whether any other actions should be taken if an investigation\nis not recommended.  \n  \n2\\. Notification to the Respondent and Opportunity to Comment.  \n  \nThe RIO shall notify the respondent whether the inquiry found an investigation\nto be warranted. The respondent shall receive a copy of the draft inquiry\nreport for comment within 14 days. Any comments that are submitted within 14\ndays will be attached to the final inquiry report. Based on the comments, the\ninquiry panel may revise the draft report as appropriate and prepare it in\nfinal form.  \n  \nThe institution may notify the complainant whether the inquiry found an\ninvestigation to be warranted and provide relevant portions of the inquiry\nreport to the complainant for comment within 14 days.  \n  \n3\\. Institutional Decision and Notification.  \n  \na. Decision by Deciding Official.  \n  \nThe RIO will transmit the final inquiry report and any comments to the DO, who\nwill determine whether an investigation is warranted. The inquiry is completed\nwhen the DO makes this determination.  \n  \nb. Notification to ORI.  \n  \nWithin 30 calendar days of the DO\u2019s decision that an investigation is\nwarranted, the RIO will provide ORI with the DO\u2019s written decision and a copy\nof the inquiry report if PHS funds were involved. The RIO will also notify\nthose institutional officials who need to know of the DO's decision. The RIO\nmust provide the following information to ORI upon request: (1) the\ninstitutional policies and procedures under which the inquiry was conducted;\n(2) the research records and evidence reviewed, transcripts or recordings of\nany interviews, and copies of all relevant documents; and (3) the allegations\nto be considered in the investigation.xii  \n  \nc. Documentation of Decision Not to Investigate.  \n  \nIf the DO decides that an investigation is not warranted, the RIO shall secure\nand maintain for 7 years after the termination of the inquiry sufficiently\ndetailed documentation of the inquiry to permit a later assessment by ORI of\nthe reasons why an investigation was not conducted. These documents must be\nprovided to ORI or other authorized HHS personnel upon request. ORI\u2019s\ninvolvement occurs only if PHS funds were involved.  \n  \nC. Conducting the Investigation  \n  \n1\\. Initiation and Purpose.  \n  \nThe investigation must begin within 60 calendar days after the determination\nby the DO that an investigation is warranted.xiii The purpose of the\ninvestigation is to develop a factual record by exploring the allegations in\ndetail and examining the evidence in depth, leading to recommended charges if\nwarranted. The investigation will also determine whether there are additional\ninstances of possible research misconduct that would justify broadening the\nscope beyond the initial allegations. This is particularly important where the\nalleged research misconduct involves clinical trials or potential harm to\nhuman subjects or the general public, or if it affects research that forms the\nbasis for public policy, clinical practice, or public health practice. The\nfindings of the investigation will be set forth in an investigation report.  \n  \n2\\. Notifying ORI and Respondent, Sequestration of Research Records.  \n  \nOn or before the date on which the investigation begins, the RIO must: (1) for\ncases involving PHS funding, notify the ORI Director of the decision to begin\nthe investigation and provide ORI a copy of the inquiry report; and (2) notify\nthe respondent in writing of the allegations to be investigated. The RIO must\nalso give the respondent written notice of any new allegations of research\nmisconduct within a reasonable amount of time of deciding to pursue\nallegations not addressed during the inquiry or in the initial notice of the\ninvestigation.xiv  \n  \nThe RIO will, prior to notifying the respondent of the allegations, take all\nreasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of, and sequester in a secure\nmanner, all research records and evidence needed to conduct the research\nmisconduct proceeding that were not previously sequestered during the inquiry.\nWhere the research records or evidence encompass scientific instruments shared\nby a number of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence\non such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent to\nthe evidentiary value of the instruments. The need for additional\nsequestration of records for the investigation may occur for any number of\nreasons, including the institution's decision to investigate additional\nallegations not considered during the inquiry stage or the identification of\nrecords during the inquiry process that had not been previously secured. The\nprocedures to be followed for sequestration during the investigation are the\nsame procedures that apply during the inquiry.xv  \n  \n3\\. Appointment of the Investigation Panel.  \n  \nThe RIO, in consultation with the Chairperson of the Ethics Committee and with\nother institutional officials, as appropriate, will appoint an investigation\npanel and the panel chair within 10 days of the beginning of the investigation\nor as soon thereafter as practical. The investigation panel must consist of\nindividuals who do not have unresolved personal, professional, or financial\nconflicts of interest with those involved with the investigation and should\ninclude individuals with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the evidence\nand issues related to the allegation, interview the respondent and complainant\nand conduct the investigation. Individuals appointed to the investigation\npanel may also have served on the inquiry panel.  \n  \nWhen necessary to secure the needed expertise or to avoid conflicts of\ninterest, the RIO may select panel members from outside the institution. The\nRIO will notify the respondent of the proposed panel membership to give the\nrespondent an opportunity to object to a proposed member or members based upon\na personal, professional, or financial conflict of interest. If so, the\nuniversity will limit the period for submitting objections to no more than 10\ncalendar days. The RIO will make the final determination of whether a conflict\nexists.  \n  \n4\\. Instructions to the Panel and the First Meeting.  \n  \nThe RIO will define the subject matter of the investigation in a written set\nof instructions to the panel that:  \n  \na. Describes the allegations and related issues identified during the inquiry;  \n  \nb. Identifies the respondent;  \n  \nc. Informs the panel that it must conduct the investigation as prescribed in\nparagraph 5 of this section;  \n  \nd. Defines research misconduct;  \n  \ne. Informs the panel that it must evaluate the evidence and testimony to\ndetermine whether, based on a preponderance of the evidence, recommended\ncharges of research misconduct will be forwarded to the Deciding Official. If\nso, the type and extent of the charges and who is being held responsible will\nbe stated;  \n  \nf. Informs the panel that in order to determine that the respondent should be\ncharged with research misconduct, it must find that a preponderance of the\nevidence establishes that: (1) research misconduct, as defined in this policy,\noccurred (respondent has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\nevidence any affirmative defenses raised, including honest error or a\ndifference of opinion); (2) the research misconduct is a significant departure\nfrom accepted practices of the relevant research community; and (3) the\nrespondent committed the research misconduct intentionally, knowingly, or\nrecklessly; and  \n  \ng. Informs the panel that it must prepare or direct the preparation of a\nwritten investigation report that meets the requirements of this policy and 42\nCFR \u00a7 93.313.  \n  \nThe RIO will convene the first meeting of the investigation panel to review\nthe allegation(s), the inquiry report, and the prescribed procedures and\nstandards for the conduct of the investigation, including the necessity for\nconfidentiality and for developing a specific investigation plan. The\ninvestigation panel will be provided with a copy of this policy and 42 CFR\nPart 93. The RIO will be present or available throughout the investigation to\nadvise the panel as needed and to provide staff support.  \n  \n5\\. Investigation Process.  \n  \nThe investigation panel and the RIO must:  \n  \na. Use diligent efforts to ensure that the investigation is thorough and\nsufficiently documented and includes examination of all research records and\nevidence relevant to reaching a decision on the merits of each allegation;xvi  \n  \nb. Take reasonable steps to ensure an impartial and unbiased investigation to\nthe maximum extent practical;xvii  \n  \nc. Interview each respondent, complainant, and any other available person who\nhas been reasonably identified as having information regarding any relevant\naspects of the investigation, including witnesses identified by the\nrespondent, and record or transcribe each interview, provide the recording or\ntranscript to the interviewee for correction and certification, and include\nthe recording or transcript in the record of the investigation;xviii and  \n  \nd. Pursue diligently all significant issues and leads discovered that are\ndetermined relevant to the investigation, including any evidence of any\nadditional instances of possible research misconduct, and continue the\ninvestigation to completion.  \n  \n6\\. Time of Completion.  \n  \nThe investigation is to be completed within 120 days of beginning it,\nincluding conducting the investigation, preparing the report of findings,\nproviding the draft report for comment and sending the final report to ORI\nwhen necessary. However, if an investigation will not be completed within this\n120-day period, the RIO will be officially notified and he/she will inform the\nrespondent of the need for an extension. Additionally, when involving PHS\nfunds, the RIO will submit to ORI a written request for an extension, setting\nforth the reasons for the delay. The RIO will ensure that periodic progress\nreports are filed with ORI, if ORI grants the request for an extension and\ndirects the filing of such reports.  \n  \nD. The Investigation Report  \n  \n1\\. Elements of the Investigation Report.  \n  \na. The investigation panel is responsible for preparing a written draft report\nof the investigation that:  \n  \n(1) Describes the nature of the allegation of research misconduct, including\nidentification of the respondent. The respondent\u2019s C.V. or resume is to be\nincluded as a part of the identification.  \n  \n(2) Describes and documents the funding agencies, including, for example, the\nnumbers of any grants that are involved, grant applications, contracts, and\npublications listing funding support;  \n  \n(3) Describes the specific allegations of research misconduct considered in\nthe investigation;  \n  \n(4) Includes the institutional policies and procedures under which the\ninvestigation was conducted, unless those policies and procedures were\nprovided to ORI previously;  \n  \n(5) Identifies and summarizes the research records and evidence reviewed and\nidentifies any evidence taken into custody but not reviewed; and  \n  \n(6) Includes a statement of charges, if warranted, for each allegation of\nresearch misconduct identified during the investigation.xix Each statement of\ncharges must: (1) identify whether the research misconduct was falsification,\nfabrication, or plagiarism, and whether it was committed intentionally,\nknowingly, or recklessly; or whether the charges fall under the University of\nHawai\u2018i\u2019s (this policy\u2019s) definition of misconduct; (2) summarize the facts\nand the analysis that support the conclusion and consider the merits of any\nreasonable explanation by the respondent, including any effort by the\nrespondent to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she did\nnot engage in research misconduct because of honest error or a difference of\nopinion; (3) identify the specific funding support; (4) identify whether any\npublications need correction or retraction; (5) identify the person(s)\nresponsible for the misconduct; and (6) list any current support or known\napplications or proposals for support that the respondent has pending with\nboth non-PHS and PHS federal agencies.xx  \n  \nb. Comments on the Draft Report and Access to Evidence  \n  \n(1) Respondent  \n  \nThe RIO must give the respondent a copy of the draft investigation report for\ncomment and, concurrently, a copy of, or supervised access to the evidence on\nwhich the report is based. The respondent will be allowed 14 calendar days\nfrom the date he/she received the draft report to submit comments to the RIO.\nThe respondent's comments must be included and considered in the final report.  \n  \n(2) Complainant  \n  \nOn a case by case basis the University may provide the complainant a copy of\nthe draft investigation report, or relevant portions of it, for comment. If\nthe institution chooses this option, the complainant\u2019s comments must be\nsubmitted within 14 calendar days of the date on which he/she received the\ndraft report and the comments must be included and considered in the final\nreport.  \n  \n(3) Investigation Report  \n  \nThe draft investigation report will be transmitted to the UH Counsel for a\nreview of its legal sufficiency. Modifications will be made as appropriate, in\nconsultation among the RIO, the Chairperson of the Ethics Committee, the\ninvestigation panel and the Institutional Counsel.  \n  \n(4) Confidentiality  \n  \nIn distributing the draft report, or portions thereof, to the respondent, and\ncomplainant the RIO will inform the recipient of the confidentiality under\nwhich the draft report is made available and may establish reasonable\nconditions to ensure such confidentiality.  \n  \nc. Decision by Deciding Official  \n  \nThe RIO will assist the investigation panel in finalizing the draft\ninvestigation report, including ensuring that the respondent\u2019s and\ncomplainant\u2019s comments are included and considered, and transmit the final\ninvestigation report to the DO, who will determine: (1) whether the\ninstitution accepts the investigation report, its findings, and the\nrecommended institutional actions; and (2) the appropriate institutional\nactions in response to the accepted findings of research misconduct. If this\ndetermination varies from the findings of the investigation panel, the DO\nwill, as part of his/her written determination, explain in detail the basis\nfor rendering a decision different from the findings of the investigation\npanel. Alternatively, the DO may return the report to the investigation panel\nwith a request for further fact-finding or analysis.  \n  \nWhen a final decision on the case has been reached, the RIO will normally\nnotify both the respondent and the complainant in writing. After informing ORI\n(when necessary), the DO will also determine whether law enforcement agencies,\nprofessional societies, professional licensing boards, editors of journals in\nwhich falsified reports may have been published, collaborators of the\nrespondent in the work, or other relevant parties should be notified of the\noutcome of the case. The RIO is responsible for ensuring compliance with all\nnotification requirements of funding or sponsoring agencies.  \n  \nd. Appeals  \n  \nThese procedures provide for an appeal by the respondent, as specified in the\nprevailing UH faculty and staff bargaining unit agreements that could result\nin a reversal or modification of the institution\u2019s findings of research\nmisconduct. Regardless of the funding source, the appeal must be completed\nwithin 120 days of its filing, unless the DO or RIO (or ORI, when PHS-funding\nis involved) finds good cause for an extension, based upon a written request\nthat explains the need for the extension. If ORI grants an extension, it may\ndirect the filing of periodic progress reports (42 CFR \u00a793.314).  \n  \ne. Notice to ORI of Institutional Findings and Actions (cases involving PHS\nfunds).  \n  \nUnless an extension has been granted, the RIO must, within the 120-day period\nfor completing the investigation submit the following to ORI: (1) a copy of\nthe final investigation report with all attachments and any appeal; (2) a\nstatement of whether the institution accepts the findings of the investigation\nreport or the outcome of the appeal; (3) a statement of whether the\ninstitution found misconduct and, if so, who committed the misconduct; and (4)\na description of any pending or completed administrative actions against the\nrespondent (42 CFR  \n\u00a793.315).  \n  \nf. Maintaining Records for Review by ORI  \n  \nThe RIO must maintain and provide to ORI upon request \u201crecords of research\nmisconduct proceedings\u201d as that term is defined by 42 CFR \u00a7 93.317 (if PHS\nfunds are involved). Unless custody has been transferred to HHS or ORI has\nadvised in writing that the records no longer need to be retained, records of\nresearch misconduct proceedings must be maintained in a secure manner for 7\nyears after completion of the proceeding or the completion of any PHS\nproceeding involving the research misconduct allegation.xxi The RIO is also\nresponsible for providing any information, documentation, research records,\nevidence or clarification requested by ORI to carry out its review of an\nallegation of research misconduct or of the institution\u2019s handling of such an\nallegation.  \n  \n  \n  \nE. Completion of Cases; Reporting Premature Closure To ORI  \n  \nGenerally, all inquiries and investigations will be carried through to\ncompletion and all significant issues will be pursued diligently. The RIO must\nnotify ORI (when necessary) in advance if there are plans to close a case at\nthe inquiry, investigation, or appeal stage on the basis that respondent has\nadmitted guilt, a settlement with the respondent has been reached, or for any\nother reason, except: (1) closing of a case at the inquiry stage on the basis\nthat an investigation is not warranted; or (2) a finding of no misconduct at\nthe investigation stage, which must be reported to ORI, as prescribed in this\npolicy and 42 CFR \u00a7 93.315.xxii  \n  \n  \n  \nF. Institutional Administrative Actions  \n  \nIf the DO determines that research misconduct is substantiated by the\nfindings, he or she will decide on the appropriate actions to be taken, after\nconsultation with the RIO. The administrative actions may include:  \n  \n1\\. Withdrawal or correction of all pending or published abstracts and papers\nemanating from the research where research misconduct was found;  \n  \n2\\. Removal of the responsible person from the particular project, letter of\nreprimand, special monitoring of future work, probation, suspension, salary\nreduction, or initiation of steps leading to possible rank reduction or\ntermination of employment;  \n  \n3\\. Restitution of funds to the grantor agency as appropriate; and  \n  \n4\\. Other action appropriate to the misconduct.  \n  \n  \nG. Other Considerations  \n  \n1\\. Termination or Resignation Prior to Completing Inquiry or Investigation.  \n  \nThe termination of the respondent's institutional employment, by resignation\nor otherwise, before or after an allegation of possible research misconduct\nhas been reported, will not preclude or terminate the research misconduct\nproceeding or otherwise limit any of the institution\u2019s responsibilities under\n42 CFR Part 93.  \n  \nIf the respondent, without admitting to the misconduct, elects to resign his\nor her position after the institution receives an allegation of research\nmisconduct, the assessment of the allegation will proceed, as well as the\ninquiry and investigation, as appropriate based on the outcome of the\npreceding steps. If the respondent refuses to participate in the process after\nresignation, the RIO and any inquiry or investigation panel will use their\nbest efforts to reach a conclusion concerning the allegations, noting in the\nreport the respondent's failure to cooperate and its effect on the evidence.  \n  \n2\\. Restoration of the Respondent\u2019s Reputation.  \n  \nFollowing a final finding of no research misconduct, including ORI concurrence\nwhere required by 42 CFR Part 93 if PHS funds are involved, the RIO will, at\nthe request of the respondent, undertake all reasonable and practical efforts\nto restore the respondent's reputation.xxiii Depending on the particular\ncircumstances and the views of the respondent, the RIO should consider\nnotifying those individuals aware of or involved in the investigation of the\nfinal outcome, publicizing the final outcome in any forum in which the\nallegation of research misconduct was previously publicized, and expunging all\nreference to the research misconduct allegation from the respondent's\npersonnel file. Any institutional actions to restore the respondent's\nreputation should first be approved by the DO.  \n  \n3\\. Protection of the Complainant, Informant, Witnesses and Committee Members.  \n  \nDuring the research misconduct proceeding and upon its completion, regardless\nof whether the institution or ORI determines that research misconduct\noccurred, the RIO will undertake all reasonable and practical efforts to\nprotect the position and reputation of, or to counter potential or actual\nretaliation against, any complainant or informant who made allegations of\nresearch misconduct in good faith and of any witnesses and committee members\nwho cooperate in good faith with the research misconduct proceeding.xxiv The\nDO will determine, after consulting with the RIO, and with the complainant,\ninformant, witnesses, or committee members, respectively, what steps, if any,\nare needed to restore their respective positions or reputations or to counter\npotential or actual retaliation against them. The RIO is responsible for\nimplementing any steps the DO approves.  \n  \n4\\. Allegation(s) or Testimony Not Made in Good Faith.  \n  \nIf relevant, the DO will determine whether the complainant\u2019s or informant\u2019s\nallegations of research misconduct were made in good faith, or whether a\nwitness, respondent, or committee member acted in good faith. If the DO\ndetermines that there was an absence of good faith he/she will determine\nwhether any administrative action should be taken.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThere is no administrative procedure specific delegation of authority.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nTo establish procedures when any event conducted by UH M\u0101noa Athletics or for\nwhich tickets are sold using the UH M\u0101noa Athletics ticket system which (1) is\nnot a University of Hawai\u2018i athletic competition and (2) which requires or may\nresult in a payment to a non-UH entity shall require a written agreement with\nthe non-UH entity regarding the rights to and disposition of proceeds of\nticket sales.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Background:  \n  \nExecutive Policy EP 8.110, Authority to Execute Contractual Documents for\nTicket Sales for Non-University of Hawai\u2018i Athletic Events Using the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa Athletics Ticket System, delegates to the Vice\nPresident for Budget and Finance/Chief Financial Officer the authority to\nexecute contractual documents relating to the rights to and disposition of\nproceeds of ticket sales for non-University of Hawai\u2018i (non-UH) athletic\nevents using the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa(UH M\u0101noa) Athletics ticket\nsystem which require or may result in a payment to a non-UH entity of $25,000\nor more. (For purposes of this administrative procedure, non-UH entities\ninclude groups and organizations which may be affiliated to the University of\nHawai\u2018i for other purposes such as fund raising, and any other entities which\nare not under the authority and control of the Board of Regents of the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i.)  \n  \nExecutive Policy EP 8.110 further delegates authority to Chancellor to execute\ncontractual documents relating to such ticket sales which require payments of\namounts less than $25,000.  \n  \nB. Procedure:  \n  \nAny event conducted by UH M\u0101noa Athletics or for which tickets are sold using\nthe UH M\u0101noa Athletics ticket system which (1) is not a University of Hawai\u2018i\nathletic competition and (2) which requires or may result in a payment to a\nnon-UH entity shall require a written agreement with the non-UH entity\nregarding the rights to and disposition of proceeds of ticket sales. Such\nagreement shall not allow payments from proceeds of the ticket sales to be\nmade to non-UH entities until after the event has been conducted, and then\nonly after all costs incurred by the University of Hawai\u2018i (including\nticketing and transactional fees) have been recovered and any facilities use\nfees, rentals and other fees agreed upon and owing to the University of\nHawai\u2018i have been received by the University. In addition, payments shall not\nbe made to an entity who is not a party to the agreement, except in the case\nof donations received in conjunction with ticket sales using the University of\nHawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa Athletics ticket system. Such donations may be paid to the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i Foundation.  \n  \nThe agreement must be approved by the Athletics Director and the Chancellor\nwith a copy of such approval being sent to the President. Agreements under\nthis procedure which require or may result in a payment to a non-UH entity of\n$25,000 or more may only be executed by the President or designee. Agreements\nwhich require payments of lesser amounts shall be executed by the Chancellor.  \n  \nNo ticket sales may commence until and unless such an agreement has been\nexecuted, and then only in accordance with such agreement and upon approval by\nthe Athletics Director, which approval shall be an indication that all\nnecessary requirements of the agreement have been complied with prior to such\nsales.  \n  \nExceptions to this procedure may be made only with approval of the Athletics\nDirector, the Chancellor and the President.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nA. To ensure that all administrative and financial management requirements for\nextramural contracts and grants are understood and complied with by all\nappropriate UH personnel. Special emphasis is placed on full compliance with\napplicable federal requirements which is mandatory.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Objectives  \n  \nTo establish guidelines and procedures which prescribe the administrative and\nfinancial management requirements for extramurally financed programs and\nactivities, to delineate fiscal and administrative responsibilities and\nfunctions within the UH, and to provide reasonable assurance that sponsored\nprograms and activities are managed in strict compliance with the terms and\nconditions specified under award agreements.  \n  \nB. Applicability  \n  \nThese guidelines and procedures shall apply to all sponsored agreements\nincluding those projects that have been service ordered to the Research\nCorporation of the University of Hawai\u2018i (RCUH) (see AP A8.930, \u201cService\nOrders to the RCUH\u201d), and subawards and agreements with nonfederal sponsors\nthat are financed directly from \"flowdown\" federal sources.  \n  \nAll sponsored agreements shall be administered at all times in strict\ncompliance with federal laws, state statutes, UH policies and procedures, and\nthe specific terms and conditions of a contract or grant award. If any federal\nstatute expressly prescribes requirements that differ from those provided\nherein, the provisions of the statute shall govern.  \n  \nC. The Essential Federal Requirements  \n  \nFor new awards issued on or after December 26, 2014 and for increments to\nexisting awards issued on or after December 26, 2014, if the Federal awarding\nagency modifies the terms and conditions or does not specifically reference\nthe OMB Circulars:  \n  \n1\\. 2 CFR 200. This final guidance supersedes and streamlines requirements\nfrom the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-21, A-110 and\nA-133. See http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-\nidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl for the complete text of this\nguidance.  \n  \nFor existing awards received prior to December 26, 2014 that do not receive\nincremental funding with new terms and conditions or sponsor prohibits\napplication of 2 CFR 200:  \n  \n1\\. OMB Circular A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.  \n  \nThis circular establishes principles for determining costs applicable to\ngrants, contracts and other agreements between the federal government and\neducational institutions. These principles shall be used to determine the\nallowable costs of work performed by colleges and universities under sponsored\nagreements.  \n  \nSee www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a021_2004/ for the complete text of this\nCircular.  \n  \n2\\. OMB Circular A-110, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and\nAgreements with Institutions of Higher Education.  \n  \nThis circular sets forth the standards for obtaining consistency and\nuniformity among federal agencies in the administration of grants to and\nagreements with institutions of higher education. It covers record-keeping,\nprogram income, cost sharing and matching, standards for financial reporting,\nmonitoring and reporting program performance, payments, revisions of financial\nplans, close-out procedures, suspension and termination procedures, and\nprocurement/property management requirements.  \n  \nSee www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a110/ for the complete text of this\nCircular.  \n  \n3\\. OMB Circular A-133, Audits of State, Local Governments and Non-Profit\nOrganizations.  \n  \nThis circular is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984 and\nAmendments of 1996. It sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and\nuniformity among federal agencies for the audit of states, local governments,\nand non-profit organizations expending federal awards.  \n  \nSee\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/circulars/a133/a133.pdf\nfor the complete text of this Circular.  \n  \n4\\. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  \n  \nThe FAR provides uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by executive\nagencies of the federal government. These federal regulations are applicable\nto contractual arrangements which the UH enters into with federal agencies\nthat are acquiring goods or services. Contract means a mutually binding legal\nrelationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services\n(including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types\nof commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated\nfunds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to\nbilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and\nnotices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering\nagreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the\ncontract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral\ncontract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative\nagreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types\nof contracts, see Part 16.  \n  \nSee https://www.acquisition.gov/far/ for a complete text of the FAR.  \n  \n5\\. Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) terms and conditions  \n  \nThe FDP is a cooperative initiative among participating federal agencies and\ninstitutional recipients of federal funds. Its purpose is to reduce the\nadministrative burdens associated with research grants and contracts.  \n  \nThe Federal-wide research terms and conditions apply to newer awards.  \n  \nThe award terms and conditions will specify whether the FDP or Federal-wide\nresearch terms and conditions apply.  \n  \nSee http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/fed_dem_part.jsp for information on the\nFDP terms and conditions.  \n  \nSee http://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/rtc.jsp for information on the Federal-\nwide research terms and conditions.  \n  \nD. Fiscal Responsibilities and Administrative Functions within the UH  \n  \nThe primary responsibility for conducting sponsored research and training\nprograms and ensuring that proper costs are charged in accordance with federal\nlaws, state statutes, sponsor requirements and UH policies and procedures\nshall reside at the organizational level where transactions are initiated and\ncontrolled. This responsibility is shared by the Principal\nInvestigator/Project Director (PI/PD), assigned Fiscal Administrator (FA),\nChancellor/Dean/Director/Department Chairperson, as applicable (\u201cAuthorized UH\nAdministrator\u201d). (Note: \"PI\" is generally used in research projects, and \"PD\"\nis generally used in science and engineering education and other projects.\nHowever, some sponsors may use these terms interchangeably and appropriate\nsubstitutions should be made accordingly.)  \n  \n1\\. The PI/PD shall be responsible and accountable for the satisfactory\nperformance of scientific and technical work prescribed under the sponsored\nprogram or activity and the review of expenditures to ensure the allowability,\nallocability and reasonableness of all costs charged to the award in support\nof the project. The PI/PD shall be accountable for any program deficits and\ndisallowances that may occur in the performance of work under the sponsored\nprogram or activity.  \n  \n2\\. The assigned FA shall be responsible for controlling program expenditures\nwithin the sponsor's funding authorization in accordance with sponsor's\nrequirements and UH policies and procedures. The FA shall also provide\nguidance and assistance to the PI/PD and staff concerning administrative and\nfinancial matters, particularly those relating to the allowability and\nallocability of program costs, sponsor's prior approval requirements if any,\nprogram financial status, delivery and coordination of administrative support\nrequirements, proper recording of expenditures and cost transfers and the\nliquidation or cancellation of all outstanding encumbrances to ensure the\ntimely closeout of projects.  \n  \n3\\. The applicable Authorized UH Administrator shall have overall\nresponsibility for the performance of work conducted by the PI/PD and shall\nmonitor and ensure that all deliverables and performance requirements are\nsatisfactorily completed within the sponsor's authorized funding and project\nperiod including the submission of the final technical reports. The applicable\nAuthorized UH Administrator shall ultimately be responsible for all program\ndeficits and cost disallowances under their jurisdiction including the\nsecuring of necessary funds to cover such costs.  \n  \n4\\. The Property and Fund Management Office (PFMO) shall be responsible for\nthe preparation and submission of the final equipment and inventory reports to\nsponsors including, the resolution of title transfers, final disposition of\nequipment and the monitoring of small business utilization reports to\nsponsors, if required.  \n  \n5\\. The Office of Research Services (ORS) shall be responsible for the\ncoordination, follow up and monitoring of all UH grants, contract and other\naward agreements with external sponsors including any revisions thereto. ORS\nshall be the focal point of contact for the UH and will serve as the liaison\nwith external sponsors. All change requests to the sponsoring agency must be\nendorsed by ORS. ORS shall also be responsible for the review and monitoring\nof reporting requirements imposed by the federal government relating to\npatents, copyrights and inventions, and the submission of periodic and final\ntechnical/performance reports to sponsors. ORS shall be responsible for\naccount establishment and maintenance, invoicing, letter of credit draw downs\nand financial reporting matters related to extramurally funded project\naccounts. ORS Compliance shall perform monitoring activities to ensure\nadherence with Federal laws, State statutes, sponsor requirements and UH\npolicies and procedures.  \n  \nE. Administrative and Financial Management Requirements  \n  \n1\\. Allowability of Program Costs  \n  \na) The allowability of costs charged to federally sponsored programs shall be\ngoverned by the provisions of 2 CFR 200 Subpart E \u2013 Cost Principles and as\nnoted in Section 4. above, OMB Circular A-21 sections C and J.  \n  \nb) PI/PD shall review the sponsored project account activity in a timely\nmanner (preferably monthly) to ensure that charges are properly recorded;  \n  \n2\\. Post-Award Changes and Other Programmatic/Budget Revisions  \n  \na) A certain degree of latitude is generally permitted by most federal\nsponsoring agencies. Changes are generally limited to minor reprogramming of\nfunds between budget categories and within the total authorized direct cost\nbudget to meet unanticipated program needs.  \n  \nb) Post-award changes requiring prior approval of the sponsoring agency are\ngoverned by the provisions of 2 CFR 200 Subpart D \u00a7200.308 and as noted in\nSection 4. above, OMB Circular A-110 Subpart C \u2013 Post Award Requirements Item\n.25  \n  \nORS shall be responsible for action on all requests for post-award changes\nwhich require sponsoring agency's approval including those institutional prior\napproval requirements that have been delegated to the UH by certain sponsoring\nagencies.  \n  \n(1) The appropriate approval shall be immediately requested when there is\nreason to believe that revisions will be necessary to meet unanticipated\nprogram needs or to accomplish certain programmatic changes. All requests to\nfunding agencies for any budgetary and programmatic changes must be initiated\nin advance and in writing by the PI/PD, reviewed by the departmental FA,\napproved by the applicable Authorized UH Administrator, and endorsed by ORS\nbefore submission to the sponsoring agency.  \n  \n(2) For subawards, the prior approval authority is usually the prime recipient\nof the grant or contract. Any action or cost that is inconsistent with the\npurpose or terms of a federally sponsored agreement shall not be approved.  \n  \nc) Although the project budget represents the best estimate of expenditures\nwhich will be incurred in the performance of the stated requirements of the\naward, a sponsoring agency may occasionally change the terms or otherwise\nmodify a contract or grant. This may affect the allowability of purchases or\nother expenditures requested on the project. If a modification or new contract\nis forthcoming, ORS should be notified immediately.  \n  \nWhen there is a degree of uncertainty for sponsor's approval of a modification\nrequested, the PI/PD will indicate an alternate source of funds to cover\nunallowable expenditures if the modification is not granted. This enables\nproject activities to proceed without delays introduced by the approval\nprocess. (Refer to AP A8.952, Advance Funding Accounts for Externally Financed\nPrograms and Activities.) In the event the changes are not approved by the\nsponsor, the FA should submit a cost transfer to clear the unallowed cost(s).  \n  \nd) Contracts and grants awarded under FDP terms and conditions delegate\napproval authority to the UH to facilitate some post-award administrative\nchanges. These delegated authorizations are administered by ORS. However, the\nfollowing post-award changes require the sponsoring agency's approval in all\ncases.  \n  \nFor awards subject to 2 CFR 200 (see section C. above):  \n  \n(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if\nthere is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).  \n  \n(2) Change in key person specified in the application or the Federal award.  \n  \n(3) The disengagement from the project for more than three months, or a 25\npercent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project\ndirector or principal investigator.  \n  \n(4) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that\nrequire prior approval in accordance with 2 CFR 200 Subpart E - Cost\nPrinciples.  \n  \n(5) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs as defined in\n2 CFR 200.75 Participant support costs to other categories of expense.  \n  \n(6) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved Federal\nawards, the subawarding, transferring or conracting out of any work under a\nFederal award. This provision does not apply to the acquisition of supplies,\nmaterial, equipment or general support services.  \n  \n(7) Changes in the approved cost-sharing or matching provided by the non-\nFederal entity.  \n  \nFor awards subject to OMB Circular A-21 and A-110 (see section C. above):  \n  \n(1) Change of the PI/PD or other key personnel.  \n  \n(2) A 25 percent reduction in the PI's level of effort.  \n  \n(3) Absence of the PI for more than three months.  \n  \n(4) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if\nthere is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).  \n  \n(5) Change in the project budget period.  \n  \n(6) The need for additional federal funding.  \n  \n(7) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in\ndirect costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the Federal awarding\nagency.  \n  \n(8) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to\ntrainees) to other categories of expense.  \n  \nIn addition, some sponsoring agencies reserve the right to approve certain\nadditional changes. Requests to the sponsoring agency for approval of any such\nchanges must be endorsed by ORS.  \n  \ne) Since it is not possible to cover all situations requiring prior approval,\nprograms should consult with ORS or the authorized officer or official of the\nsponsoring agency whenever rebudgeting or other post-award changes are\ncontemplated or if there are uncertainties regarding the allowability of costs\nor activities.  \n  \n3\\. Continuation Accounts (Suspense Accounts)  \n  \nA continuation account must be designated on all accounts with an expiration\ndate and is used to accept transactions posted to an expired account. FAs\nshall review transactions posted to continuation accounts in a timely manner\nand transfer the amounts to the proper account. Campus level FAs are\nresponsible for ensuring that balances in the continuation accounts are\ncleared by fiscal year end.  \n  \n4\\. Expenditure Controls / Cost Overruns  \n  \nFA s shall monitor allotments, expenditures and project periods to ensure that\ndeficits and past due conditions are prevented or corrected. An expenditure\nrecorded in a sponsored project account in excess of the approved project\nbudget may result in a cost overrun. Cost overruns and inappropriate charges\nmust be reversed or transferred to an appropriate non-sponsored account.  \n  \n5\\. Cost Transfers  \n  \nCost transfers are an after-the-fact correction or reallocation to move costs\nfrom or to an extramural project account. With the FA's assistance, PIs shall\nreview and reconcile all sponsored accounts in a timely manner. Cost transfers\nshould generally be processed no later than 90 days after the date of the\noriginal transaction (preferably within 60 days after posting of original\ntransaction) in order for the UH to prepare accurate financial statements and\nreceive proper reimbursement from our sponsors. An explanation of why the cost\nwas incorrectly charged in the first place, and why a transfer is necessary\nshall be provided. Documentation to support the authorization of the cost\ntransfer shall also be attached, if applicable. If the transfer is to a\nsponsored account, certification that the charge is allowable, allocable and\nreasonable is required.

Purpose\n\nA. To establish guidelines and procedures for the uniform application of\nfacilities and administrative (F&A) cost rates in proposals and awarded\nprojects; for securing waivers from approved F&A cost rates; and applying F&A\ncost rates to multi-year grants and contracts, continuation funding and\nsupplemental funding.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Applicability  \n  \nThese guidelines and procedures shall apply to all extramurally funded\nprojects.  \n  \nB. Guidelines  \n  \nThe following guidelines shall be followed to ensure the consistent treatment\nand inclusion of appropriate facilities and administrative cost rates in\ncontract or grant proposals and awarded projects.  \n  \n1\\. Unless facilities and administrative cost recovery is limited or\nprohibited by statute, regulation, or approved by Federal awarding agency head\nand communicated to the Office of Management and Budget, proposal budgets\nshall provide for full recovery of F&A costs via the most current rate\nidentified under the College and Universities Rate Agreement between the\nUniversity and the US Department of Health and Human Services Cost Allocation\nServices that is appropriate for the proposed program or activity (also known\nas function) and location.  \n  \na. F&A costs are classified under one of three major functions:  \n  \n(1) Sponsored research \u2013 Systematic study directed toward increasing\nscientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. Includes\ndevelopment, which uses the knowledge gained through research toward the\nproduction of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods. Also includes\nresearch training, where the training activity occurs in or uses the same\nfacilities as research projects (e.g., K, F32, and T32 awards).  \n  \n(a) Special research rates have been developed for research programs or\nactivities as follows:  \n  \n(i) Applied Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii (ARL at UH). For\nresearch programs or activities conducted by the ARL at UH.  \n  \n(ii) Kaka\u2018ako Research. For research programs or activities performed or\nconducted on the Kaka\u2018ako Campus.  \n  \n  \n(2) Sponsored instruction \u2013 All teaching and training activities established\nby grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. Includes curriculum development;\nspecial student services established by grant, contract, or cooperative\nagreement; and service learning projects where students receive academic\ncredit.  \n  \n(3) Other sponsored activities \u2013 Activities that involve the performance of\nwork other than research or training. For example, performances and\nexhibitions; workshops and conferences; evaluations; and operation of clinics,\nextension services, and small business development centers. Other sponsored\nactivities also include clinical trials performed for pharmaceutical\ncompanies.  \n  \nb. On- or off-campus rates are applied in accordance with the following\nguidelines:  \n  \n(1) On-campus rates shall be used when programs or activities are\npredominantly performed or conducted by University personnel, including\nproject staff hired through RCUH, in facilities that are operated and\nmaintained by the University. On-campus rates apply regardless of whether\nfacilities support is provided by the campus or by the schools, research\nunits, or departments.  \n  \n(a) A list of on-campus sites is provided in Attachment 1.  \n  \n(2) Off-campus rates shall be used when programs or activities are\npredominantly performed or conducted by University personnel in facilities\nprovided by the sponsor (either at no cost or paid for by the grant or\ncontract) or a third party, or in the field.  \n  \n(3) Predominance shall mean that more than 50% of the work is performed or\nconducted at the location.  \n  \n(4) In determining whether a program or activity occurs on-campus or off-\ncampus, the work of subawardees shall not be considered. This is because the\nF&A cost rates apply to University activity and where it is performed or\nconducted.  \n  \nc. Rate agreement calculation base  \n  \n(1) The rate agreement calculation base is modified total direct costs (MTDC).  \n  \n(2) MTDC consists of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and\nsupplies, services, travel, and the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless\nof the period covered by the subaward). MTDC excludes equipment, capital\nexpenditures, charges for patient care, tuition remission, rental costs of\noff-site facilities, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs,\nthe portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000, and specialized service\nfacility charges.  \n  \n(3) Subaward refers to the programmatic work under a grant or contract. It\ndoes not refer to contracts for goods or services, which are subject to full\nF&A costs.  \n  \n(4) Specialized service facility (SSF) charges refer to charges from the\nfollowing SSF's: IFA Job Order Services, IFA Mauna Kea Midlevel Facility,\nSOEST Computing Facility, SOEST Engineering Facility, and SOEST Ship\nOperations.  \n  \nd. Waivers  \n  \nExcept for sponsor limitations or prohibitions on F&A costs that can be\nverified through the web (e.g., such as through a US Office of Management &\nBudget listing of Federal sponsor F&A rate deviations), any waiver from the\nmost current rates on the Colleges and Universities Rate Agreement shall\nrequire the written approval (either in memo or email format) of the\nrespective campus Chancellor or designee.  \n  \n2\\. Awards of Multi-Year Grants or Multi-Year Contracts  \n  \na. Multi-Year Grants. In accordance with OMB Circular A-21 and 2 CFR 200\nAppendix III, the F&A cost rates in effect at the time an award is made shall\nbe used throughout the life of the award.  \n  \nb. Multi-Year Contracts. Where the FAR clause at 52.216-15 is incorporated\ninto the contract, the predetermined F&A cost rates in effect for the fiscal\nperiod in which costs are incurred shall apply.  \n  \n3\\. Continuation Funding.  \n  \na. For grants or contracts that will be extended without competition, the F&A\ncost rates in effect at the time the original award was made shall be used in\nproposals for continuation funding.  \n  \nb. For grants and contracts that will be subject to competition, the most\ncurrent F&A cost rates shall be used in proposals for continuation funding.  \n  \n4\\. Supplemental Funding. Unless sponsor policies state otherwise,\nsupplemental funding will be considered new funding. Thus, the most current\nF&A cost rates shall be used in proposals for supplemental funding.  \n  \nC. Procedures  \n  \nPrincipal Investigators (PI) or Project Directors (PD), with the assistance of\nthe Fiscal Administrator (FA), shall budget for full recovery of F&A costs in\nproposals by using the most current rates in the Colleges and Universities\nRate Agreement subject to the following:  \n  \n1\\. Limitation or prohibition on facilities and administrative cost rates. The\nPrincipal Investigator should provide copies of or a web address for the\napplicable statute, regulation, policy statement, or request for proposal that\nidentifies the F&A cost rate limitation or prohibition along with the myGRANT\nProposal Development record when the proposal is submitted to the Office of\nResearch Services as support.  \n  \na. Letters from the sponsor that do not reference applicable statutes,\nregulations, or policy statements that can be verified through the web are not\nacceptable. Such letters should be considered requests for waivers and\nsubmitted to the appropriate campus Chancellor or designee for review and\napproval.  \n  \n2\\. Waivers of facilities and administrative cost rates.  \n  \na. The PI/PD should determine well in advance whether a F&A waiver should be\nobtained for the proposal. Should the PI/PD determine that this is the case,\nthe PI/PD should draft a memo or email request for waiver to the respective\ncampus Chancellor or designee. The format may vary from campus to campus, but\nshould be via the respective Dean/Director and include the amount of the\nwaiver, the reason for the request, the benefit to be derived by the\nUniversity as a result of the waiver, and the ramifications if the approval is\nnot granted. A copy of the approved waiver request should be included with the\nmyGRANT Proposal Development record when the proposal is submitted to the\nOffice of Research Services as support.  \n  \nb. For federally funded grants and contracts either received directly by UH or\nvia a pass-through entity that are not subject to F&A rate\nlimitations/prohibitions or do not have a prior approved UH F&A waiver, UH\nexpects to receive F&A costs based on the current F&A rates in effect at the\ntime the award is made per OMB Circular A-21 and 2 CFR 200 Appendix III. The\nPI/PD with the assistance of the FA should re-budget to accommodate the\ncurrent F&A rates. The PI/PD may request a waiver from the respective campus\nChancellor or designee at the time of award to avoid re-budgeting.  \n  \n3\\. Tracking of Unrecovered Indirect Costs. Whenever a sponsor limitation on\nF&A costs is accepted or waiver of F&A costs is made, the amount of\nunrecovered indirect costs shall be tracked in myGRANT in accordance with the\nmyGRANT general instructions. Unrecovered indirect costs is the difference\nbetween the amount the University could have recovered if it was allowed to\ncharge its applicable federally negotiated F&A rate and the amount actually\nbudgeted for F&A in the proposal.  \n  \n4\\. The Office of Research Services may issue instructions on how to handle\nF&A rates when awards are made during a transition from an old F&A rate\nagreement to a new F&A rate agreement.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policy regarding admissions policies.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. The board shall provide for differential admissions policies on system\ncampuses and clear communication of university expectations to prospective\nstudents. In pursuing this purpose, the board intends to provide for a mix of\nstudents while ensuring preference for qualified Hawai\u2018i residents. In doing\nso the following principles are established:  \n  \n1\\. The University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa, the University of Hawai\u2018i at Hilo and\nthe University of Hawai\u2018i \u2013 West O\u2018ahu shall utilize selective admissions\ncriteria for all colleges and programs.  \n  \n2\\. The University\u2019s community colleges shall be open admissions institutions\nto which all residents who are high school graduates or age 18 and over and\ncan benefit from the instruction offered shall be admitted. This policy does\nnot preclude selective admissions to specific programs of the community\ncolleges where pre-requisite skills and knowledge are necessary for program\nsuccess or where student demand exceeds the available resources of the\ncollege.  \n  \n3\\. Each chancellor that uses selective admissions criteria for undergraduate\nadmission shall develop, in concert with campus administrators and faculty:  \n  \na. Admission requirements communicated to assure prospective applicants who\nmeet them of admission to the campus.  \n  \nb. Other admission criteria that are used to determine the admission of\nstudents who do not meet the higher, assured admissions criteria.  \n  \nc. Assured admission requirements and other criteria shall be published in\ncollege catalogs and otherwise widely publicized to allow students to plan in\nadvance for entering the campuses of the university.  \n  \nB. Differential admissions policies may be established for resident and non-\nresident students. In establishing admissions criteria for non-residents, the\ncampuses shall utilize the following principles:  \n  \n1\\. A public university\u2019s first responsibility is to provide higher education\nopportunities for qualified students from the community that supports it.  \n  \n2\\. No qualified resident applicant should be denied admission to a university\ncampus. Implementing this policy is a major responsibility of both the two-\nyear and baccalaureate granting campuses.  \n  \n3\\. At all campuses, but particularly at the community colleges, programs\nestablished for the explicit purpose of educating and training students to\nmeet state manpower needs have a special obligation to admit qualified\nresidents who can reasonably be expected to remain in the state upon\ngraduation.  \n  \n4\\. Graduate and professional programs have a special responsibility to admit\nthe most qualified students while demonstrating that every effort is made to\nenroll resident applicants who compete favorably in the admissions process.  \n  \n5\\. Professional programs at the four-year and graduate level must be\ncognizant of their responsibility to educate adequate numbers of resident\nprofessionals to serve state needs. In addition to these numbers, qualified\nnonresidents who pay a higher tuition can enhance the mix of students.  \n  \n6\\. In general, the admission of nonresidents should give priority to those\nwho can derive special benefit from focuses of the university.  \n  \n7\\. Campus ceilings for nonresident undergraduate enrollments shall be\nestablished by the president in consultation with the board. The president\nshall promulgate policies and procedures relating to the establishment of the\nceiling.  \n  \nC. Graduate admissions criteria are established by program faculty with the\napproval of the chancellor.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\n  1. The following guidelines outline the academic program approval and termination process from authorization to plan through established status. Chancellors/Provost will develop procedures to implement this policy as required for their campus. \n  \n  \n\n  2. The objectives of the executive policy are:  \n\n    1. To establish guidelines and procedures for the preparation and processing of authorizations to plan, proposals for new academic programs, and reviews of provisional programs.\n  \n\n    2. To assure the administration and Board of Regents of the academic and fiscal soundness of proposed and provisional programs and their appropriateness to both University-wide and campus missions.\n  \n\n    3. To assure the administration and the Board of Regents that provisions for adequate physical facilities for the programs have been included in campus long-range development plans.\n  \n\n    4.

To assure the administration and the Board of Regents that provisions for meaningful assessment of student learning have been included in proposals for new academic programs and reviews of provisional programs.\n\n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nDefinitions of all degrees and certificates offered by the University of\nHawai\u2018i System are provided in EP 5.205.  \n\n  1. Program  \n\n    1. For purposes of Board of Regents approval, an academic program is any sequence of courses or instructional activities required to complete a specific degree, inclusive of required coursework within the major, concentration/specialization, and minor.\n  \n\n  2. Authorization to Plan (ATP)  \n\n    1. An authorization to plan is a request to authorize planning for a new academic program made to the UH Officers at the beginning of the formal program planning process before resources are committed.\n  \n\n  3. Provisional Program  \n\n    1. New programs shall be considered provisional during the period of their first full cycle. A cycle is 150% of the proposed length for baccalaureate and graduate degrees and up to 300% for certificates and associate degrees. At the end of the cycle, provisional programs are eligible to become established.\n  \n\n  4. Established Program  \n\n    1. Are permanent programs that must undergo periodic comprehensive review.\n  \n\n  5. Termination  \n\n    1. Programs that are terminated are removed from the official list of degrees and certificates.\n  \n\n  6. Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)  \n\n    1. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) provides a taxonomic scheme that supports the accurate tracking and reporting of fields of study and program completions activity. CIP was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1980, with revisions occurring regularly.\n  \n\n    2. Each program CIP code is aligned to the NCES CIP title (when possible) and definition and is used for reporting of programs to the NCES.\n  \n\n    3. A CIP code and title generally apply to all levels of certificates and degrees.\n  \n\n  7. Official Program Name  \n\n    1. The name of the program, including parenthetical information, is approved by the Board of Regents at the time of program establishment. It is the official name for purposes of Board of Regents-conferred credentials and is used in University publications.\n  \n\n  8. Significant Change  \n\nA major modification or expansion of the nature of an academic program,\nincluding content, objective, or goals.\n\n  \n\n* Significant Resources  \n\n  1. As defined in RP 5.201, significant resources includes one or more of the following: new faculty or staff positions, new facilities including lab or office space, and/or new operating costs that must be requested through a new budget request to the board and/or Legislature. This would not include situations in which resources can be internally reallocated from other units in the college, department, division, or school in the context of reprioritizing programs and services.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n  1. As described in RP 5.201, the Board approval is required for all new instructional programs granting academic credit leading to a degree or credential, upon recommendation by the President with the exception of those in B, C and D below. The President can then delegate approval as outlined in B, C and D.\n  \n\n  2. Credentials listed below can be approved by the President or designee if the program does not require significant resources:  \n\n    1. An established program which desires to change to or add a new type of degree (e.g. BA to BS, AS in xx to AS in zz) with minimal change to degree requirements.\n  \n\n  3. Approval of credentials listed below may be delegated to the Vice President for Community Colleges (VPCC) or Vice President for Academic Strategy (VPAS) if the program does not require significant resources:  \n\n    1. All new stand-alone certificates of competence or academic subject certificates.\n  \n\n    2. A stand-alone certificate where the existing Board-approved associate degree or certificate of achievement is being terminated.\n  \n\n  4. Credentials listed below may be delegated to the Chancellor or Provost if the program does not require significant resources:  \n\n    1. New minors, concentrations or certificates consisting of courses within or among existing Board-approved instructional programs.\n  \n\n    2. A stand-alone minor where the existing Board-approved major is being terminated.\n  \n\n  5. Program Name  \n\n    1. The name of the program, including parenthetical information, and the Classification of Instructional Property (CIP) code approved by the Board of Regents at the time of program establishment becomes the Official Program Name and CIP code for purposes of Board of Regents-conferred credentials and is used in University publications.\n  \n\n    2. Program names and CIP codes should align with titles, descriptions and CIP codes for similar programs in the national database and should be consistent across campuses unless the program name is unique to our system or there is a documented reason for the difference. The Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy (OVPAS) must approve program names and CIP codes not aligned with the national standard or across the institution. A Master List of Board of Regents-authorized degree and certificate programs, and programs approved by the President or Chancellor/Provost, is maintained by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy.\n  \n\n    3. Requests to change the Official Program Name in order to maintain currency in terminology and which involve no substantive change in the program are made to the President. Upon approval, such changes are reported to the Board of Regents as an information item.\n  \n\n    4. Official Program Name changes that reflect a substantive program change are handled according to the requirements for new program authorizations as outlined in this policy.\n  \n\n    5. Any program name change must be aligned with the correct Classification of Instructional Property (CIP) code and title.\n  \n\n    6. No program shall be given a name to honor a person without approval of the Board.\n  \n\n  6. Authorization To Plan (ATP)  \n\n    1. The purposes of the ATP are to:  \n\n      1. Coordinate academic program planning actions.\n  \n\n      2. Request approval from administrators to proceed with planning. \n  \n\n      3. Inform the administration of long-term academic program planning intentions; the long-term physical facilities requirements of planned programs; and provide opportunities for appropriate feedback.\n  \n\n    2. Guidelines for the ATP process are developed by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy in consultation with the Council of Chief Academic Officers (CCAO). Guidelines for the ATP can be found in Appendix A.\n  \n\n    3. ATPs are evaluated by the Officers as to fit with the mission of the unit, relationship to existing programs on each campus and in the UH system, and reasonableness of the proposed plan. Approval of the proposal authorizes a campus to proceed with planning and developing a formal proposal for the program.\n  \n\n    4. After the Officers approve, ATPs are reviewed by CCAO who provide feedback to the proposing campus.\n  \n\n    5. Faculty senates will be informed of approved ATPs.\n  \n\n  7. Proposal for New Academic Programs  \n\n    1. A program proposal sets forth the description of, and justification for, new academic programs sought by the campuses.\n  \n\n    2. The proposal must contain sufficient information to permit assessment of the academic integrity and quality of the program, to determine its fiscal soundness and efficiency relative to other University activities, and to determine its appropriateness to the mission of the University and the campus. See Appendix B for guidelines for preparing the proposal.\n  \n\n    3. The proposal must have an appropriate CIP code approved by the OVPAS.\n  \n\n    4. Procedures and Processing   \n\n      1. Each unit establishes internal procedures for the preparation and processing of new program proposals, ensuring appropriate faculty (including faculty senate review where required by internal procedures) and student input and attention to the questions outlined in Appendix B.\n  \n\n      2. Program proposals are reviewed by the Council of Chief Academic Officers (CCAO) for feedback on the content and scope of the proposal, academic integrity, and relationship with programs on each campus and offered by other campuses to ensure program differentiation.\n  \n\n      3. Proposals endorsed by CCAO as ready to move forward for approval are submitted to the President by the campus.\n  \n\n      4. The Office of the President reviews the proposal and (if approved), the program name and CIP code are approved by the OVPAS.\n  \n\n      5. The proposal is then sent to the Board of Regents with a recommendation for approval as provisional.\n  \n\n  8. Provisional Programs  \n\n    1. All programs approved by the Board of Regents are placed on provisional status during their first cycle of operation.\n  \n\n    2. No tenure appointments shall be made in new programs until the Board of Regents has reviewed the provisional cycle and elected to continue the program. Resources for newly approved academic programs are sought in accordance with standard budgetary policies and procedures.\n  \n\n    3. Each provisional program shall undergo a comprehensive review at the end of its first full cycle. The review shall examine the program\u2019s actual achievement of its proposed enrollment, completion, resource use, impact, and role in the curriculum.\n  \n\n    4. A review cycle is 150% of the proposed length of the degree for baccalaureate and graduate degrees and up to 300% for certificates and associate degrees and master\u2019s degrees.\n  \n\n    5. The review cycle schedule will be:  \n\n      1. The review is due in 3 years for a 1-year certificate.\n  \n\n      2. The review is due in 6 years for a 2-year associate\u2019s degree.\n  \n\n      3. The review is due in 6 years for a 4-year bachelor\u2019s degree.\n  \n\n      4. The review is due in 6 years for a 2-year master\u2019s degree.\n  \n\n      5. The review period for a Ph.D. shall be 150% of the expected time to completion established on approval of provisional status.\n  \n\n    6. Chancellors/Provost establish procedures for the preparation, review, and approval of provisional programs within their units ensuring appropriate faculty and student input.\n  \n\n  9. Proposal to Establish a Program   \n\n    1. A proposal to the Board for \u201cestablished\u201d status of a provisional program shall be submitted in the academic year following the end of the program\u2019s first full cycle. The first year of a program is considered the academic year in which students first declare a major in the degree or certificate.\n  \n\n    2. The provisional to established proposal is outlined in Appendix C. The proposal to established status should summarize and reflect on the program review, the self-study of the provisional program, and the quantitative indicators included in Appendix C.\n  \n\n    3. The proposal shall be based upon and summarize the comprehensive review of the program.\n  \n\n    4. Campuses may request, and the President or designee may grant, an extension for one year for provisional programs.\n  \n\n    5. The provisional to established proposal is brought to CCAO for comment and endorsement.\n  \n\n    6. The Chancellor/Provost then transmits the proposal for established status to the President for approval by the Board via an action memo that summarizes:   \n\n      1. A statement of program objectives. Differences between the final program objectives and those found in the program proposal should be explained.\n  \n\n      2. An assessment of whether or not the program is meeting its objectives and a summary of the evidence used to reach this conclusion.\n  \n\n      3. A discussion of any substantial changes made in the program since its approval and any substantial discrepancies in program indicators or activities from those identified in the program proposal.\n  \n\n      4. A projection of resource needs for the next five years.\n  \n\n  10. Program Stop-Outs and Terminations  \n\n    1. Degree programs may be stopped out by the Chancellor/Provost based on the criteria in item III.J.4. Degree programs may be terminated by the President based on criteria in item III.J.5. Termination of all certificates and stand-alone minors may be approved by the Chancellor/Provost.\n  \n\n    2. A program stop-out indicates the program is no longer accepting new students. A stopped out program is noted as stopped out, but it is not removed from the UH System official list of degrees and certificates offered.\n  \n\n    3. A terminated program is no longer accepting new students, and it is removed from the official list of degrees and certificates. A program scheduled for termination should generally be preceded by a stop-out period that provides time for students currently in the program to graduate.\n  \n\n    4. A degree program may be stopped out by the Chancellor/Provost if one of the following criteria applies:  \n\n      1. It is scheduled for termination and requires a period to teach out existing students in the program;\n  \n\n      2. It is undergoing curriculum redesign with the intention to continue the program after a temporary stop-out;\n  \n\n      3. It is listed on the Programs with a Small Number of Graduates report for 5 years and stop-out is recommended as a result of a comprehensive program review.\n  \n\n      4. It is determined to be under performing after an external review, and stop-out is recommended by either the department, the Dean, or the campus Chief Academic Officer.\n  \n\n    5. A degree program may be terminated by the President if it meets one of the following criteria:  \n\n      1. The program or Dean recommends termination;\n  \n\n      2. It is listed on the Programs with a Small Number of Graduates report and termination is recommended as the result of a comprehensive program review;\n  \n\n      3. Recommended for termination by the Chancellor/Provost to the President;\n  \n\n      4. It is determined to be under performing after an external review and termination is recommended.\n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe President delegates approval of all certificates and minors described\nabove where a previously Board-approved degree program exists to the\nChancellor/Provost.  \n  \nThe President delegates the approval of all stand-alone certificates of\ncompetence at the community colleges to the Vice President for Community\nColleges and at the 4-year campuses to the Vice President for Academic\nStrategy.  \n\n##  V.

Disclosures, acknowledgments, and consent. The \u201cApplication and Notification of Conditional Participation in a Covered Program\u201d form will provide the Candidate with disclosures, acknowledgments, and consent information including the Candidate\u2019s rights under Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes Chapter 378 and under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Execution of the authorization and consent by the Candidate will grant the University and its designees authorization to check the Candidate\u2019s criminal history.  \n\n        1. Cooperation required. All Candidates shall cooperate fully and make every reasonable effort to comply with the background check requirements when notified by the Covered Program Administrator or their designee and/or the Responsible Campus Official.\n  \n\n        2. Failure to provide authorization and consent. Failure to provide authorization and consent to a background check will preclude a Candidate from consideration for a position within a Covered Program.\n  \n\n    2. Candidate acknowledges Executive Policy EP 2.202, Safety and Protection of Minors. The Covered Program Administrator or their designee will provide all prospective Non-UH Volunteers with the Policy and secure their acknowledgement of the receipt of the policy.\n  \n\n    3. BCC reviews the \u201cApplication and Notification of Conditional Participation in a Covered Program\u201d form and issues a determination on the prospective of the applicant in a program with minors. For Non-UH Volunteer positions, the following review is the minimum required. However, a program may choose to enhance the background check process based upon their unique programmatic needs and protocols. The background checks for Non-UH Volunteers will consist of the following:  \n\n      1. Hawai\u2018i Criminal Justice Data Center (\u201cHCJDC\u201d) statewide criminal history record information system (\u201cCJIS-Hawaii\u201d) website: http://ag.hawaii.gov/hcjdc/\n  \n\n      2. Hawai\u2018i Sex Offender Registry and National Sex Offender Public Registry\n  \n\n      3. If the individual will be driving Covered Program Minors, then a motor vehicle driving record search is required\n  \n\n  4. Background Check Process for Contractors and Other Non-University Organizations.  \n\n    1. Background checks for contractors or other individuals employed or otherwise affiliated with non-University organizations who have contact with Covered Program Minors shall be conducted by such non-University organizations.\n  \n\n    2. The non-University organizations should be required to certify to the University in writing what background checks were completed and that nothing in the background of each of the Covered Programs bear adversely upon his or her ability to provide for the safety and well-being of Covered Program Minors.\n  \n\n  5. Background Check Results  \n\n    1. Compliance with Applicable Law. The timing, process, and use of criminal history information is subject to significant legal compliance, obligations; and thus all background checks will be conducted, and all information and results will be used, only in accordance with applicable law.\n  \n\n    2. Confidentiality of Background Check Results  \n\n      1. Confidential File. The background check report is maintained in a confidential file separate from a Candidate\u2019s application file or a UH Covered Person\u2019s personnel file. Notwithstanding the foregoing, criminal convictions are considered public records and may be disclosed to the public.\n  \n\n      2. No Criminal Record. If the background check does not reveal any prior criminal record for a Candidate, the BCC shall input the results into a secured repository. The BCC will then notify the appropriate Covered Program Administrator or their designee of the background check clearance for such Candidate.\n  \n\n      3. Prior Criminal Record. If the background check reveals a prior criminal record for a Candidate, the Background Check Coordinator, in consultation with the Director of the System Office of Human Resources, will evaluate the Candidate\u2019s suitability for the Covered Program.  \n\n        1. Factors to Consider. The BCC will consider the relevance of the Candidate\u2019s criminal history in relation to the Candidate\u2019s prospective role in the Covered Program, including a case-by-case assessment of various factors including but not limited to the nature and circumstances surrounding the offense, the conviction\u2019s temporal proximity, any recidivism, and any relationship between the conduct that resulted in the conviction and the Candidate\u2019s prospective role in the Covered Program. The Background Check Coordinator should review the Candidate\u2019s background for any indications of: violence, alcohol or drug abuse, sex offense, offense involving children, or any other circumstance which indicates that the Candidate may pose a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of children.\n  \n\n        2. When appropriate, any of the following may be consulted: (1) panel of faculty experts; (2) Office of Academic Affairs (or equivalent) for the campus; (3) Human Resources; and/or (4) the University\u2019s employee and labor relations consultant.\n  \n\n    3. Negative Background Checks for University Community Members. If the Background Check Coordinator\u2019s evaluation of a Candidate\u2019s background check results in the recommendation for adverse action against the Candidate, the Background Check Coordinator will communicate the outcome of the background check results to the Campus Program Administrator. By formal notice in writing and within five (5) business days, the Candidate may request the following actions:  \n\n      1. Provide Candidate with a copy of background check results. The Background Check Coordinator shall provide the Candidate with a copy of the background check results (if requested) and a copy of the Summary of Your Rights in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).\n  \n\n      2. Opportunity to respond/dispute background check results and/or recommended action. The Background Check Coordinator shall allow the Candidate five (5) business days to respond in writing to the information revealed in the background check and/or the BCC\u2019s recommended adverse action.\n  \n\n      3. Appeals procedure. In the case of an adverse action that may mean a Candidate does not meet the criteria to work with minors, there is an opportunity to appeal the decision. Candidates must respond and/or dispute such information and/or recommended adverse action within the applicable time frames and process set forth by the University in Administrative Procedure AP 9.110, with the proviso that subparagraph 6.c does not apply since the Background Check Coordinator acts as the Chancellor\u2019s Designee in this matter.\n  \n\n      4. No Response. If the Candidate does not respond or responds and the University upholds its decision, the Background Check Coordinator must provide the Candidate a letter detailing the final adverse decision.\n  \n\n      5. Existing Employees with Negative Result. If a Candidate who has been employed by the University and working with minors prior to implementation of this policy receives a negative background check that precludes the Candidate from participating in a program with minors, the employee will not be approved for a program with minors.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf the negative background check indicates a criminal history that may render\nthe employee unsuitable for continued employment at the University, the\ncriminal violation will be analyzed within the nexus of the employee\u2019s duties\nand responsibilities. If proven that such a nexus exists, the employee will be\nseparated from University service.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf a Candidate who has been employed by the University and working as a part\nof their faculty or staff position with minors prior to implementation of this\npolicy receives a negative background check that precludes the Candidate from\nfulfilling his or her job (but does not render the employee unsuitable for\ncontinued employment at the University), the University will make a reasonable\neffort to find alternative employment.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor faculty, their duties may be reorganized so that they are no longer\ninteracting with minors. If it is not possible to reorganize faculty duties to\navoid contact with minors within the home department, then a faculty member\nwho is tenured or tenure-track may seek to transfer to another department,\nsubject to the receiving department\u2019s and Dean\u2019s approval. The faculty\nmember\u2019s position and funding for the position may follow them to the\nreceiving department, if they are transferred. If a transfer is not possible,\nthe tenured or tenure-track faculty member will be terminated after four (4)\nmonths. For those tenured faculty whose primary responsibilities related to\nworking with minors evolved over time from the original intention of their\nfaculty position, suitability for continued University employment will be\nanalyzed on a case-by-case basis.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor other University employees, they may be transferred to an alternative\nposition that does not involve working with minors. If no such position is\navailable at the same level, a lower level position will be identified for\nwhich the employee will be qualified. If a transfer to a different position is\nnot possible, the employee will be terminated after three (3) months.\n\n  \n\n    4. Negative background check for Non-UH Volunteers will follow the same process as for employees.\n  \n\n  6. Obligation to Disclose and Re-Check of Covered Persons.   \n\n    1. Background checks are valid for the period of the Covered Person\u2019s appointment in the program.  \n\n      1. No Break in service. Once a Candidate has successfully cleared the background check process and has been accepted as a Covered Person, he/she will not need to be background checked as long as no break in service occurs or he/she is not dismissed as a Covered Person.\n  \n\n      2. Break in service. Covered Persons who previously cleared a background check, who previously participated in a Covered Program, and who have a break in service must disclose any convictions that occurred during the break prior to their participation in activities and programs with Covered Program Minors \n  \n\n      3. Break in service greater than twelve (12) months. Covered Persons will be re-screened, including fingerprinting, if there is a break in service for twelve (12) months or more or if new information arises regarding their background.\n  \n\n    2. Subsequent events. All Covered Persons shall notify the BCC of any subsequent events that might alter the background check.\n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe authority to oversee the Covered Programs\u2019 compliance with the\nrequirements and responsibilities set forth in this policy is delegated to the\nProvost/Chancellors of UH four-year campuses and the Vice President for\nCommunity Colleges who will appoint an executive University employee as the\nResponsible Campus Official for each respective campus.  \n\n##  V.

In general, equivalents for terminal degrees will be used sparingly and only when there is clear evidence that the substituted items of training and experience are in fact equivalent in qualifying the faculty member for the individual\u2019s duties and responsibilities.\n  \n  \n\n    4. Individual campuses may develop additional duties and responsibilities in accordance with their unique needs and campus missions.\n  \n  \n\n    5. The classification of faculty positions in the University of Hawai\u2018i shall be as provided in the attachments for the 4-year campuses and for the Community Colleges.\n  \n  \n\n    6. Positions that were approved and under recruitment prior to August 1, 2024, may be hired under the preceding classification system.  \n  \nAttachment 1: 4-Year Campus Classification  \nAttachment 2: University of Hawai\u2018i Community Colleges Classification  \nAttachment 3: Legacy Classifications (UH M\u0101noa, UH Hilo and UH West O\u2018ahu\nclassification documents prior to approval of the current classification plan\nand in effect until all individuals have transitioned out of these\nclassifications).\n\n  \n  \n\n    7. The compensation of faculty members shall be in accordance with provisions reflected in the most current collective bargaining agreement between the University of Hawai\u2018i and the exclusive representative.\n  \n  \n\n    8. The adjunct faculty series is intended to encourage the utilization of qualified, experienced persons from the local community in appropriate educational programs and thereby to enhance and improve the integration of practical real world experience with conceptual, theoretical, and vicarious instruction. Adjunct faculty are further defined in the classification attachment where relevant.\n  \n  \n\n    9. Lecturers  \n  \nThe Provost/Chancellors shall develop academic standards for the hiring of\nlecturers on their respective campuses or divisions. Lecturers shall be paid\nand receive benefits and any other compensation according to the collective\nbargaining agreement. The rates shall be paid on the basis of the policies and\nrates in effect on the campus where the course is taught. Lecturers who are\nappointed to teach not more than six-credit hours at the M\u0101noa, Hilo, and West\nO\u2018ahu campuses and those appointed to teach not more than seven-credit hours\nat Community Colleges are carrying less than half-time load equivalent.  \n  \nLecturers are hired to meet temporary, part-time requirements, and should not\nbe used to replace regular full-time faculty. Use of lecturers should be\nreviewed annually by departments and colleges. Optimal use of lecturers will\nvary by unit to support student success. Lecturers should not, as a general\nconcept, be hired to teach more than 100% across the University system as\ndefined in EP 9.214. Lecturers employed full-time elsewhere (outside UH\nemployment) should not be appointed for more than six-credit hours per\nsemester or nine-credit hours during the academic year (the same limits as for\nfull-time University faculty members). Lecturers who are appointed after the\nstart of classes and who do not teach the full course(s) shall receive a pro-\nrata share of the lecturer stipend. The formula to be used is: the\ninstructional class hours completed divided by the instructional class hours\nrequired for the course, multiplied by the total amount payable for the entire\ncourse.\n\n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth a policy regarding provision of clinical and mental health care\nservices for the university and to address student health insurance for\ninternational students.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. Philosophy & Rationale  \n  \n1\\. The provision of clinical and mental health care services is an\neducationally legitimate and critical function of any college or university\ngiven the dramatic rise in diagnosable physical and mental illness and related\nbehavioral problems. As a part of their attendance, college students are\nexposed to illness and to the hazard of injury resulting from the manipulation\nof various equipment or supplies or through participation in athletic,\nrecreational and co-curricular activities. Because they may be living away\nfrom home or domiciled on or near campus, many college students no longer have\naccess to their customary clinical health services. Consequently, establishing\nclinical health services on the campuses of the university can ensure access\nto medical care for its students by providing convenient treatment of injury\nand illness.  \n  \n2\\. College attendance creates a unique set of circumstances and stressors\nthat may trigger growth and development in significant ways. College students\noften possess physical and emotional needs unique to their age group and\nenvironmental context. It is typically during the college matriculation period\nthat students experience change, need to address personal and identity\ndevelopment issues, work through psychosocial and interpersonal challenges,\nand deal with growth, development, and more change. The presence and\navailability of mental health counseling services on the campuses of the\nuniversity afford students the opportunity to address psychosocial and\npsychological concerns in more intentional and healthy ways.  \n  \n3\\. In fostering students' general well-being to succeed academically, the\nuniversity may also provide a variety of services and programs designed to\nremove physical and psychological impediments to educational success. Besides\nthe referral of students to specialized health resources unavailable on\ncampus, clinical and mental health services professionals may need to increase\ntheir collaboration in order to address the complexity of problems students\npresent. As a part of this need to collaborate, the university may compile\nclinical and mental health records or require a variety of examinations,\nimmunizations, psychological assessments or follow-up tests to assist students\nin dealing with severity of their presenting concerns.  \n  \n4\\. Thus, in order to encourage students to take responsibility for\nmaintaining their physical and psychological well-being, the university of\nHawai\u2018i establishes policies for clinical and mental health services.  \n  \nB. Parameters  \n  \n1\\. In providing for the safety, health and well-being of its students, the\nuniversity, through its administration, shall comply with all applicable\nrequirements of federal, state, and other governmental agencies as may be\nrequired by law or by rules and regulations.  \n  \n2\\. The president or the president\u2019s designee shall, by Executive Policy, set\nforth guidelines to determine the level of care for clinical and mental health\nservices to be provided by the campuses.  \n  \n3\\. Additionally, the president or the president\u2019s designee shall, by\nExecutive Policy, assure university-wide availability of a student health\ninsurance plan(s).  \n  \nC. All non-immigrants on student visas are required to enroll in a university\nendorsed student health insurance plan or furnish proof of enrollment in a\nhealth insurance program whose benefits meet the minimum insurance\nrequirements set by the president or the president\u2019s designee by Executive\nPolicy.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nSetting the minimum insurance requirements is delegated to the president or\nthe president\u2019s designee. See RP 7.207(C).  \n\n##  V.

Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Applicability & Declaration  \nThis policy shall apply to all campuses of the University of Hawaii and shall\nserve as a declaration of the University\u2019s commitment to fostering students\u2019\nhealth and well-being through prevention promotion programs and restorative\nservices.  \n  \nB. Each campus of the University shall provide at least Level 1 care of\nclinical health and mental health services outlined in Appendix A of this\npolicy and shall offer a higher level of service when appropriate and feasible\nin accordance with guidelines found in this policy. Adequate on-campus\nfacilities shall be made available to carry out Level 1 services.  \n  \nC. Depending upon its assessed needs, each campus shall determine the scope\nand level of clinical health and mental health services appropriate for its\nstudent population. The level of needs of the students at each campus is\nrelated to a variety of factors as outlined below. These factors shall be\nweighed and considered by each campus in determining its appropriate level of\ncare of clinical health and mental health services to be maintained.  \n  \n1\\. The demographics of the campus student population.  \n2\\. The number of students residing on or near campus, and their demographics.  \n3\\. The existence of academic programs or other activities which by their\nnature are potentially hazardous.  \n4\\. A determination of health needs of enrolled students, taking into account\ntheir financial resources, living patterns, and their individual awareness of\nand regard for personal health and developmental issues.  \n5\\. The availability of medical and mental health resources in the surrounding\ncommunity.  \n6\\. The degree to which students are willing to support various health\nservices through, among other ways, payment of a health service fee or the\npurchase of health insurance.  \n7\\. The financial resources of the campus including the priority placed upon\nthe funding of existing and/or new programs and the campus commitment to the\nprovision of clinical health and mental health services.  \n8\\.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policy regarding the community college system.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. The board shall develop and administer a system of community colleges.  \n  \nB. The intent of the board is to make the university accessible to every\nHawai\u2018i resident who wants and can benefit from the opportunities and\nexperiences provided by the community colleges.  \n  \nC. The university community colleges are a critical component of the\nuniversity system. The community colleges are characterized by comprehensive\nprograms, low tuition, open-door admission, educational guidance, high quality\nteaching, and responsiveness to their respective communities by remaining at\nthe forefront of educational innovation.  \n  \nD. As a system, the community colleges offer collegiate liberal arts and\nscience instruction, career and technical programs, developmental academic\ninstruction, continuing education, public and community service programs,\nworkforce development and training, related support services, and, upon board\napproval, programs in affiliation with other institutions where the community\ncolleges are uniquely suited to engage in these specific offerings.  \n  \nE. The community colleges complement each other in programs and contribute as\nequal partners in the university\u2019s lower division general education program.  \n  \nF. The board, in its capacity as regents and as members of the State Board for\nCareer and Technical Education, directs the president to implement the\nfollowing:  \n  \n1\\. Community colleges will continue to be open-admission, providing access to\nhigh school graduates and other adults age 18 or older who can benefit from\nits programs particularly disadvantaged residents.  \n  \n2\\. The community college campuses shall differentiate their roles and focus.  \n  \na. The Oahu community colleges as a group shall continue to provide a\ncomprehensive set of courses and programs. However, as each campus develops\nits special programmatic focus, individual colleges may reduce their\ncomprehensiveness.  \n  \nb. The neighbor island community colleges shall continue to provide a\ncomprehensive set of courses and programs, using both traditional and distance\nlearning strategies.  \n  \n3\\. The strategic plan for the community colleges shall take into account\npredictable workforce requirements in the state and address how the campuses\nwill respond.  \n  \n4\\. In cooperation with labor and management, the community colleges shall\ncontinue to provide educational leadership for apprenticeship training and\nrelated educational programs.  \n  \n5\\. Educational programs, including short-term certificate programs and non-\ncredit programs shall be planned to maximize the career options offered and\nreach other than regularly enrolled students.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nA. To formalize and codify current University of Hawai`i (UH) policy requiring\nall \u201cUH Employees\u201d (including faculty, researchers, administrators, etc.) to\ncomply with United States (US) Export Control Laws and Regulations. For\npurposes of the applicability of this specific Executive Policy, \u201cUH\nEmployees\u201d includes UH employees, as well as employees of the Research\nCorporation of the University of Hawai\u2019i (RCUH).  \n  \nB. To provide guidance to all \u201cUH Employees\u201d (as defined herein to include\nRCUH employees) in the application of US Export Control Laws and Regulations,\nin order to ensure that they understand their duties and obligations, and\ncomply with said laws and regulations.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. \u201cDeemed Export\u201d refers to the release of export-controlled technical data,\ntechnology, and/or source code, to a Foreign National, whether in the US or\nabroad, as such a release is deemed to have been exported to the Foreign\nNational\u2019s home country(ies). Deemed Exports can occur through visual or oral\ndisclosures.  \n  \nB. \u201cExport Controls\u201d are US Export Control Laws and Regulations that restrict\nthe export of certain Technology or Technical Data, commodities, or software\n(\u201cExport-Controlled Items\u201d) to a foreign country or to a Foreign National,\nwhether that foreign national is inside or outside the US. As such, a license\nor other type of government authorization may be required for:  \n  \n1\\. The export of \u201cExport-Controlled Items,\u201d which include:  \n  \na. Defense articles enumerated on the US Munitions List (USML), 22 CFR \u00a7 121;\nand/or  \n  \nb.

Lists\nof Parties of Concern and Specially Designated Nationals are maintained by the\naforementioned federal agencies, and also include US citizens and entities.  \n  \nE. \u201cSanctioned Countries\u201d are those countries targeted by the US Department of\nthe Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control for asset and trade\nrestrictions, to accomplish US foreign policy and national security goals.\nSanctioned countries include those which the US imposes a full trade embargo\non, known as \u201cEmbargoed Countries.\u201d  \n  \nF. \u201cTechnology\u201d or \u201cTechnical Data\u201d refers to technical information beyond\ngeneral or basic marketing materials about an Export-Controlled Item. The\nterms do not refer to the controlled item itself, or to the type of\ninformation contained in publicly available user manuals. Rather, the terms\nTechnology and Technical Data mean specific information necessary for the\ndevelopment, production, or use of an Export-Controlled Item.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. INTRODUCTION  \n  \n1\\. All UH Employees (as defined herein to include RCUH employees) are\nrequired to comply with Export Controls, which include, but are not limited\nto, those Laws and Regulations issued by the US Department of Commerce through\nits Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR \u00a7 730-774; the US\nDepartment of State through its International Traffic in Arms Regulations\n(ITAR), 22 CFR \u00a7 120-130; and the US Department of the Treasury through its\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), 31 CFR \u00a7 500-599.  \n  \n2\\. The US has imposed restrictions on exports since 1940, when Congress\npassed the Export Control Act. More recently, in the aftermath of September\n11, 2001, the US government increased its scrutiny of Export Controls,\nparticularly with respect to universities and academic research that could\nresult in the disclosure of Technology, or Technical Data, which threatens\nnational security, foreign policy, and competitive trade interests of the US.\nThis is especially true since there has been a significant increase in\nresearch awards (contracts, subcontracts, and grants) received by\nuniversities, from both federal and industrial sponsors, with export control\nrestrictions.  \n  \n3\\. Export Controls apply not only to UH sponsored research and training\nactivities, but to all UH activities in general. Groups, such as the Council\non Government Relations (COGR), have studied the impacts of existing and\nproposed export controls regulations on their higher education members, and\nhave raised objections with applicable federal agencies. However, researchers\nwhose work may have export control implications (e.g., research involving\nDepartment of Defense or defense contractors), must be aware of and comply\nwith all applicable US Export Control Laws and Regulations.  \n  \n4\\. Failure to comply with Export Controls may lead to significant civil\nand/or criminal penalties, including but not limited to, monetary penalties of\nup to $1,000,000 per violation; prison terms of up to 20 years; denial of\nexport privileges; and debarment from US government contracts. Violations of\nExport Controls can result in personal as well as institutional liability.  \n  \nB. POLICY GUIDELINES  \n  \n1\\. This policy shall apply to all UH sponsored or unsponsored research,\ntraining, and educational activities, including extramural contracts and\ngrants accepted by UH and service-ordered to RCUH.  \n  \n2\\. Responsibilities.  \n  \na. The UH Office of Export Controls (OEC) shall act as the UH compliance\noffice for all UH and RCUH export control activities and be responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Promulgating specific procedures and guidelines for Export Controls\ncompliance;  \n  \n(2) Providing available training to all UH Employees in Export Controls;  \n  \n(3) Evaluating export control scenarios brought to OEC\u2019s attention and\nproviding regulatory guidance, upon request;  \n  \n(4) Determining which Federal export license exemptions and exceptions are\nappropriate for export control matters;  \n  \n(5) Screening UH and RCUH transactions for exports to or financial\ntransactions with Sanctioned Countries, Parties of Concern, and Specially\nDesignated Nationals so as necessary to ensure compliance with US Export\nControl Laws and Regulations;  \n  \n(6) Promulgating a Master Technology Control Plan for UH, as prescribed by the\nNational Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and ITAR;  \n  \n(7) Evaluating export control matters with the hiring of Foreign Nationals\n(for both UH and RCUH positions) so as to comply with Federal requirements for\nthe I-129 immigration process;  \n  \n(8) Investigating and reporting instances of misconduct in accordance with\nExecutive Policy 12.211;  \n  \n(9) Conducting Risk Assessment activities, as necessary, to validate\ncompliance with US Export Control Laws and Regulations;  \n  \n(10) Submitting export license applications and other requests for Federal\napprovals, and acting as \u201cEmpowered Official\u201d for UH for the purpose of\napplying for export licenses from the US Department of State;  \n  \n(11) Drafting and submitting voluntary self-disclosures made to the Federal\nGovernment concerning any violations of Export Controls; and  \n  \n(12) Any and all other duties as necessary and appropriate to ensure export\ncompliance.  \n  \nb. The Principal Investigator (PI), or equivalent Supervisor, shall be\nresponsible for:  \n  \n(1) Identifying all Export-Controlled Items that are used or created in the\nconduct of their work, and preventing export of those items without specific\ngovernment approvals or licenses in place;  \n  \n(2) Identifying Foreign Nationals involved in the conduct of their work and\npreventing Deemed Exports from occurring without specific government approvals\nor licenses in place to authorize disclosures to Foreign Nationals;  \n  \n(3) Preventing exports (including travel) to, or financial transactions with,\nSanctioned Countries, Parties of Concern, and Specially Designated Nationals\nwithout specific government approvals or licenses in place;  \n  \n(4) Exporting in compliance with regulations governing the use of any\ngovernment approvals or export licenses received, and compliance with any\nprovisos or conditions that those approvals or licenses may impose;  \n  \n(5) Exporting in compliance with regulations governing the use of any export\nlicense exemptions or exceptions;  \n  \n(6) Notifying OEC of potential export controls scenarios and execution of a\nProject-Specific Technology Control Plan if recommended by OEC;  \n  \n(7) Cooperating with OEC-led Risk Assessment activities so as necessary to\nensure compliance with Export Controls; and  \n  \n(8) Obtaining UH-provided training in Export Controls, as appropriate and\nnecessary to comply with US Export Control Laws and Regulations.  \n  \nc. All UH Employees shall be responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Obtaining UH-provided training in Export Controls, as appropriate and\nnecessary, to comply with US Export Control Laws and Regulations;  \n  \n(2) Assisting OEC with the identification of Export-Controlled Items and\nForeign Nationals;  \n  \n(3) Cooperating with OEC-led Risk Assessment activities so as necessary to\nensure compliance with Export Controls;  \n  \n(4) Notifying OEC when UH Employees request foreign travel approval,\nparticularly to a Sanctioned Country; and  \n  \n(5) Following all UH policies and procedures related to Export Controls, as\nidentified in UH Administrative Procedures and the OEC website\n(http://www.hawaii.edu/research/export-controls/).  \n  \nd. The UH Office of Research Services (ORS) shall be responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Identifying and negotiating the removal of any language in contracts with\nFederal Government or private entities that prevents UH from utilizing the\nFundamental Research Exemption; and notifying OEC in the event that such\ncontract language is accepted;  \n  \n(2) Participating in training provided by OEC, as necessary and appropriate,\nto ensure export compliance; and  \n  \n(3) Notifying OEC of any potential Export Control issues or concerns arising\nout of, or in conjunction with, any matter that is processed through ORS.  \n  \ne. The UH Office of Technology Transfer and Economic Development (OTTED) shall\nbe responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Identifying issues with Export Controls arising out of, or in conjunction\nwith, Material Transfer Agreements, or other licensing agreements, and\nnotifying OEC of such issues;  \n  \n(2) Participating in training provided by OEC, as necessary and appropriate,\nto ensure export compliance; and  \n  \n(3) Notifying OEC of any potential Export Control issues or concerns arising\nout of, or in conjunction with, any matter that is processed through OTTED.  \n  \nf. UH Information and Technology Services (ITS) shall be responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Providing OEC with information and access to information necessary to\nassist OEC with its duties to ensure compliance with US Export Control Laws\nand Regulations.  \n  \ng. The UH Faculty and Scholar Immigration Services (FSIS) shall be responsible\nfor:  \n  \n(1) Maintaining a process for PIs and Supervisors to certify to export\ncompliance so as to comply with Federal requirements for the I-129 immigration\nprocess; and  \n  \n(2) Notifying OEC of any potential Export Control issues or concerns arising\nout of, or in conjunction with, any matter that is processed through FSIS.  \n  \nh.

The UH Office of Human Resources (OHR) shall be responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Providing OEC with information and access to information necessary to\nassist OEC with its duties to ensure compliance with US Export Control Laws\nand Regulations; and  \n  \n(2) Notifying OEC of any potential Export Control issues or concerns arising\nout of, or in conjunction with, any matter that is processed through OHR.  \n  \nj. The RCUH Office of Human Resources (RCUH HR) shall be responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Maintaining a process for PIs and Supervisors to certify to export\ncompliance so as to comply with Federal requirements for the I-129 immigration\nprocess; and  \n  \n(2) Notifying OEC of any potential Export Control issues or concerns arising\nout of, or in conjunction with, any matter that is processed through RCUH HR.  \n  \nk. The UH General Counsel (UGC) shall be responsible for:  \n  \n(1) Providing legal assistance to OEC as necessary, including not limited to\nproviding official UH responses to certain actions by the Federal Government\n(e.g., subpoenas, etc.); and  \n  \n(2) Working with OEC to address Export Control issues, as necessary and\nappropriate, to ensure UH compliance with US Export Control Laws and\nRegulations.  \n  \n3\\. Situations that involve the release of Technology or Technical Data about\nExport-Controlled Items, and thus require the prior approval or license from\nthe US Government may include, but are not limited to:  \n  \na. An employee's oral or visual disclosure of Technology or Technical Data to\na Foreign National;  \n  \nb. Foreign National employees involved in certain research, development, and\nmanufacturing activities; Foreign National students or scholars conducting\nresearch; and  \n  \nc. Hosting of Foreign National visitors, scholars, or exchange students.  \n  \n4\\. In general, Export Controls cover five types of UH (as well as RCUH)\nactivities:  \n  \na. Transmission of Export-Controlled Items, including Technology or Technical\nData to persons, including US citizens and US entities, outside the US;  \n  \nb. Shipment or hand-carry of Export-Controlled Items that require export\nlicenses, from the US to a foreign country;  \n  \nc. Provision of defense services, as defined by ITAR, to Foreign Nationals\noutside the US;  \n  \nd. Verbal, written, electronic, or visual disclosure of controlled scientific\nand technical information related to Export-Controlled Items to Foreign\nNationals, even when such releases occur within the US (See \u201cDeemed Export\u201d\ndefinition herein); and  \n  \ne. Travel to certain Embargoed Countries, as identified by OFAC, for purposes\nof teaching classes, performing research, or otherwise conducting UH business.\n(See \u201cSanctioned Countries\u201d definition herein).  \n  \nNOTE: There are many additional activities which may involve Export Controls,\nand a detailed analysis of each scenario must be conducted to ensure\ncompliance with US Export Control Laws and Regulations.  \n  \n5\\. The majority of exports do not require export licenses. Only exports of\nitems that are enumerated on the USML or CCL, and exports to Sanctioned\nCountries, Parties of Concern, or Specially Designated Nationals, require\nlicenses, if no available license exemption or exception is applicable. UH\u2019s\nresearch and educational activities may be exempt from Export Controls if they\nmeet the criteria for certain exemptions which include, but are not limited to\nthose described in this policy. It is important to note that these exemptions\nare not available for exports of certain types of encryption software, and\nthat they only apply to disclosure of Technology or Technical Data to Foreign\nNationals in the US. They do not apply to the actual shipment or hand carrying\nof Export-Controlled Items outside of the US, or to the provision of defense\nservices. Other license exceptions provided for in EAR may apply to exports of\nequipment and services, but not those described in this policy.  \n  \nIt is incumbent upon UH Employees to ensure any export control exemptions\napplied to UH and/or RCUH activities are done so in accordance with federal\nregulations. When in doubt about the applicability of a license exemption or\nexception, it is recommended that a US Department of State or Commerce license\nbe sought so as to eliminate the risk of an inadvertent export violation.\nAdditionally, both EAR and ITAR regulations contain requirements for\nrecordkeeping, particularly for the use of some exceptions.  \n  \na. Fundamental Research Exemption:  \n  \n(1) Fundamental research is defined as basic and applied research in science\nand engineering at an accredited US institution of higher education, the\nresults of which are ordinarily published and shared broadly within the\nscientific community. Fundamental research is distinguished from proprietary\nresearch, the results of which are restricted for proprietary reasons, or\nresearch that has had specific US Government access and dissemination controls\nimposed on it. Pre-publication review by a sponsor solely to insure that the\npublication would not inadvertently divulge proprietary information that the\nsponsor has furnished to the researchers does not change the status of\nfundamental research, so long as the review causes no more than a temporary\ndelay in publication of the research results. If research is funded by the US\nGovernment and specific national security controls or foreign policy controls\nare agreed upon to protect information resulting from the research, the\nFundamental Research Exemption is not applicable and exports are subject to\nlicense requirements.  \n  \n(2) The Fundamental Research Exemption (or exclusion) may apply to the use of\nitems on the USML or CCL by a Foreign National researcher, such that they may\nview the technology or equipment, without an export license, normally required\nfor Deemed Exports. The fundamental research exemption is only applicable so\nlong as there are no restrictions on publication of the research,\ndissemination of information, access to the research, and as long as the\nresearch or information is publically available.  \n  \n(3) Release of Technology or Technical Data not within the scope of the\nFundamental Research Exemption to any Foreign National is known as a Deemed\nExport. Further, the Fundamental Research Exemption applies only to the\ndissemination of the research data and information including non-encrypted\nsoftware and not the transmission of material goods. This exemption cannot be\nused for the export of Export-Controlled Items, and/or other tangible\nmaterials to other countries. A license to ship Export-Controlled Items from\nthe US is required prior to shipment, even when the Export-Controlled Items\nresult from fundamental research.  \n  \n(4) Since 9/11, there has been a greater tendency towards \u201cregulation by\ncontract.\u201d For example, there are new federal funding programs that are\nincreasingly linked to export controls or government security controls such as\nbioterrorism, homeland security, and cybersecurity. At the same time, however,\nboth EAR and ITAR provide that the Fundamental Research Exemption will be lost\nif a university or its researchers accept any government or private sponsor\u2019s\ncontractual language that:  \n  \n(a) Restricts publication of scientific and technical information resulting\nfrom the project or activity, other than a normal time-limited prepublication\nreview to identify patentable subject matter or inadvertent disclosure of\nproprietary information furnished by a sponsor;  \n  \n(b) Forbids the participation of Foreign Nationals; or  \n  \n(c) Otherwise operates to restrict participation in research and/or access to\nand disclosure of research results; e.g., when the research is funded by the\nUS Government with specific access and dissemination controls that protect\ninformation resulting from the research.  \n  \n(5) To the extent that UH and/or RCUH activities fall under the Fundamental\nResearch Exemption, there would be no need for an export license.  \n  \nb. Public Domain Exemption:  \n  \n(1) Although Export Controls cover nearly all fields of science and\nengineering, UH may not need to obtain a license to disclose Technology or\nTechnical Data to Foreign Nationals through classes, laboratories,\npublication, or conferences, if the information is in the public domain.\nInformation is in the public domain if it is published and generally\naccessible to the public through unlimited and unrestricted distribution, or\nthrough fundamental research in science and engineering at an accredited US\ninstitution of higher learning, where the resulting information is ordinarily\npublished and shared broadly in the scientific community. However, this\nexemption does not cover exports of encryption software.  \n  \n(2) Information is \u201cpublished\u201d (and therefore not subject to export controls)\nwhen it becomes generally accessible to the interested public in any form,\nincluding:  \n  \n(a) Publication in periodicals, books, print, electronic, or other media\navailable for general distribution (including websites that provide free,\nuncontrolled access) or to a community of persons interested in the subject\nmatter, such as those in a scientific or engineering discipline;  \n  \n(b) Readily available at libraries open to the public or at university\nlibraries;  \n  \n(c) Patents and published patent applications available at any patent office;\nand  \n  \n(d) Release at an open conference, meeting, seminar, trade show, or other\ngatherings held in the US (ITAR) or anywhere (EAR).  \n  \n(3) To the extent that UH and/or RCUH activities fall under the Public Domain\nExemption, there would be no need for an export license.  \n  \nc. Educational Information Exemption:  \n  \n(1) Both EAR and ITAR contain another exemption known as the Educational\nInformation Exemption that authorizes the disclosure of educational\ninformation released by instruction in catalog-listed courses at a university,\nincluding through lectures, instruction in teaching laboratories, and\ninclusion in course materials.  \n  \n(2) EAR\u2019s exemption also extends to software, with the exception of certain\nencryption software.  \n  \n(3) Although not referred to explicitly as an Educational Information\nExemption, in ITAR, technical data is defined for the purposes of establishing\nexport controls and exempts information concerning general scientific,\nmathematical or engineering principals commonly taught in schools, colleges\nand universities from Export Controls.  \n  \n(4) To the extent that UH and/or RCUH activities fall under the Educational\nInformation Exemption, there would be no need for an export license.  \n  \n(5) When UH and/or RCUH activity is not covered by one of the foregoing\nexemptions, it is critical that UH seek a license from the appropriate Federal\nagency early, since it can take as long as six months or more to receive a\nlicense after submission of the license application.  \n\n##  IV.

Executive Policy\n\nA. INTRODUCTION  \n  \n1\\. Employees of the University of Hawai'i (University) and the Research\nCorporation of the University of Hawai'i (RCUH) have a special obligation to\ncommit their time, efforts, and intellect to its educational, administrative,\nservice, research, and scholarship missions. The University does, however,\nencourage its employees, where appropriate, to pursue outside activities and\nsponsored research that may benefit not only the University but also the\npublic, as well as to expand upon the employee's intellectual capabilities. In\nso doing, University employees are expected to act ethically and with the\nutmost integrity. Executive Policy EP 12.214 addresses concerns regarding\nconflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest refer to situations in which an\nemployee's financial, professional, or other personal interests may influence,\nor appear to influence, the employee's judgment in fulfilling his or her\nresponsibility to the University. Conflicts of interest may also include\ninstitutional or individual financial, scholarly, and organizational conflicts\nof interest, as well as conflicts of commitment. As a steward of public funds,\nthe University has a responsibility to ensure that all of its activities-\nwhether institutional or individual and particularly those related to\nteaching, public service, administration, and research-do not threaten the\nintegrity of the University's and faculty's activities.  \n  \n2\\. Executive Policy EP 12.214 is based primarily on the National Science\nFoundation (NSF) conflict of interest policies\n(http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/manuals/gpm05 131/gpm5.jsp#510) and Public Health\nService (PHS) regulations (42 CFR Part 50 Subpart F and 45 CFR Part 94), but\nalso includes broader requirements and disclosure standards specific to the\nUniversity. For Project Directors (PDs) and Principal Investigators (Pis)\nserving designated roles on funded grant awards, guidelines under this policy\nshould be considered in conjunction with rules of the granting agency. PDs and\nPis are also required to abide by the University's Office of Research Services\n(ORS) Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) policies and procedures (APM\nA8.956) and specific instructions for required disclosures. In the cases of\nprivate for-profit commercial sponsors of research, the employee should\ncontact the University's Office of Technology Transfer and Economic\nDevelopment (OTTED), http://www.otted.hawaii.edu/. John A. Burns School of\nMedicine faculty and staff may obtain additional guidance from the \"JABSOM\nPolicy on Interactions with Industry\"\n(http://jabsom.hawaii.edu/jabsom/about/doc/coi_final_11_11_10.pdf). EP 12.214\nis set forth in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 84 of the\nHawai'i Revised Statutes.  \n  \nB. GUIDING PRINCIPLES  \n  \n1\\. This policy applies to all faculty members, staff and administrators,\nincluding employees of the University, all Research Corporation of the\nUniversity of Hawaii (RCUH) employees involved in University research\nactivities, and all students who are either employed or receiving stipends as\na result of their involvement in University research activities.  \n  \na. Commitment to Ethical Conduct  \n  \n(1) The University encourages and supports outside activities on the part of\nits employees that are consistent with the strategic plan and missions of the\nUniversity, and which may benefit society. However, it is vital that these\nactivities be conducted ethically to maintain integrity in research and\nscholarship. Outside interest(s) and activities may potentially affect\nUniversity business, research, education, administration, or decisions in ways\nthat could result in an inappropriate personal gain or confer an improper\nadvantage.  \n  \n(2) Employees are expected to separate their University and private interests\nin accordance with state law, federal regulations, and University procedures\nand policies. The University is committed to ensuring that teaching, research,\npublic service, administration, and business operations are performed in\naccordance with the highest standards of ethical conduct, and to preserving\nthe public's trust in the integrity of activities undertaken by the University\nand its employees.  \n  \nb. Appropriate Research Activity for the University  \n  \n(1) Research projects undertaken by faculty and other researchers must be\nconducted in accordance with the missions of the University; i.e., promising\nsignificant contributions to scholarship and knowledge and, when possible,\nproviding appropriate opportunities for students.  \n  \nc. Open Environment for Teaching and Research  \n  \n(1) The teaching and research environment should promote the free exchange of\nideas, information, and materials among students and faculty. Selection of\nstudents for participation in research projects should serve the student's\nbest interests and should not be influenced by private economic or\nprofessional interests of the principal investigator, project director,\nmentor, or professor.  \n  \nd. Open Publication and Sharing of Research Results  \n  \n(1) Consistent with the Board of Regents policy,\n(http://www.hawaii.edu/offices/bor/policy/borpch12.pdf), minimal limitations,\nif any, should be placed on the investigator's ability to freely publish and\notherwise disseminate information about research activities and results in the\nmanner of his or her choosing.  \n  \n(2) Appropriate Use of University Facilities and Resources. In accordance with\nHawai'i Revised Statutes (\u00a784-13), university resources, including \"...state\ntime, equipment or other facilities...\" cannot be used for private business\npurposes. However, with respect to state time, faculty members can \"engage in\nconsulting, contract, or private employment during the duty period...\" if such\nactivity does not \"... exceed one (1) day or an accumulation of eight (8)\nhours per calendar week excluding Sundays and holidays\" (July 2009 - June 2015\nAgreement between the University of Hawai 'i Professional Assembly and the\nUniversity of Hawai 'i Board of Regents (UH-BOR)).  \n  \ne. Employee's Responsibility for Disclosure  \n  \n(1) Individuals who accept employment at the University, are otherwise\nappointed to a position at the University, or are providing services to the\nUniversity as a Research Corporation of the University of Hawai'I (RCUH)\nemployee, are responsible for self-disclosing, in writing, any personal\npotential or actual, significant financial interest or other conflict of\ninterest. Definitions of conflict of interest are set forth in Administrative\nProcedures APM A5. 504. Unless excluded, each employee is required to annually\ndeclare whether he/she has personal significant financial interests or other\nconflicts of interest. Those individuals who may qualify for exemptions from\nthe disclosure requirement are identified in APM A5.504. Failure to report\nsignificant financial interests as defined in APM A5.504 and/or APM A8.956\nconstitutes a violation of this policy. Further, the failure of an employee to\nself\u00ad disclose a financial conflict of interest, or failure to adequately\nresolve a conflict when so directed, may be grounds for disciplinary action up\nto and including termination of employment.  \n  \n(2) Disclosure forms are found in Attachment A of APM A5.504.  \n  \nf. Outside Activities  \n  \n(1) The University encourages external activities that enhance an employee's\nvalue to the University or that provide a public service. Such service to\noutside educational, professional, scientific, artistic, cultural, civic,\nbusiness, or other organizations is permissible under the terms of this policy\nand APM A5.504 (i.e., as long as the activity does not pose an unresolved\nconflict of interest or commitment).  \n  \n(2) A conflict of interest can create an appearance of impropriety even if no\nimproper act results from it. The existence of a conflict, in and of itself,\nmay not present a violation of this policy. Individuals and the institution\nare expected to appropriately manage and resolve conflicts to avoid the\nappearance of impropriety. The conflicts of interest committee, described in\nAPM A5.504, has been established to assist with management and resolution of\nconflicts of interest and commitment.  \n  \ng. Institutional Financial Conflicts of Interest.  \n  \n(1) The principles that guide and limit the activities of individuals also\napply to activities of senior administrators who represent the University. To\nbe disclosed and managed or avoided are conflicts of interest on the part of\ntrustees, senior managers or academic units where there is an external\nrelationship or financial interest in a private entity that has a financial\ninterest in University research or scholarly activity. Service by senior\nadministrators or trustees of the University on boards of organizations that\nhave significant business activities with the University may also result in a\nconflict or the appearance of a conflict.  \n  \nh. Organizational Conflicts of Interest  \n  \n(1) When providing advice or services to governmental agencies or private\nsector entities, the University is to avoid biases or the appearance of\nbiases, particularly when there is the possibility of gaining an unfair\nadvantage in competition for financial or other resources as a result of\nproviding the advice or services.  \n  \ni. Scholarly Conflicts of Interest  \n  \n(1) The University expects its scholars to adhere to the highest standards\nwhen requested to review and comment on the works of other scholars. Bias\nshould not influence a reviewer's evaluation of the works of others. This is\nparticularly true when the reviewer has the potential for personal, financial\nor professional gain through negative, wrongful or unfair criticism that may\ndamage the reputation of a colleague and/or lessen the colleague's chances of\nobtaining funding, publishing a manuscript, or obtaining a promotion.  \n  \nj. Conflicts of Commitment  \n  \n(1) Employees of the University are hired to perform assigned duties in\nsupport of the interests and official functions of the University.  \n  \n(2) Conflicts of commitment may arise when the employee's outside interests\nand work exceed, in terms of time committed, what is expected by the\nUniversity, in accordance with the terms of his or her employment contract. In\naddition, there may be a conflict of commitment if the outside work differs\nsignificantly in character from the official functions of the University.  \n  \n(3) Commitment issues are to be addressed by the senior administrator\ncommunicating directly with the employee. This is to be regarded as an\nadministrative matter not requiring involvement of the Conflict of Interest\nCommittee, as described in APM A5.504.  \n  \nk. Assistance  \n  \n(1) If questions or concerns arise regarding conflicts of interest or\ncommitment, the Office of Research Services, Compliance Section shall be\ncontacted.  \n  \n(2) The procedures and processes that apply to conflicts of interest and\ncommitment issues are found in APM A5. 504 and A8.956. This policy and related\nprocedures shall be amended and updated as necessary.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThere is no policy specific delegation of authority.  \n\n##  V.

Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Continuation Clearing Accounts  \n  \n1\\. KFS requires that a continuation chart code and continuation account\nnumber be provided when an account has an expiration date. Charges assessed\nafter the account has expired are routed to the respective continuation\naccount assigned.  \n  \nB. Continuation Account Attributes  \n  \n1\\. In order for the continuation accounts to be identifiable, all\ncontinuation accounts will have certain specific attributes irrespective of\nthe account chart code. See Attachment 1.  \n  \n2\\. Other continuation account attributes: Fund Group, Sub-Fund Group Type,\nPayroll fringe Imposed Status, and UH Fund-Appropriation need to agree to the\nexpiring account. See Attachment 2.  \n  \nC. Assigning Continuation Accounts on Contracts & Grants Accounts  \n  \n1\\. At a minimum, each FO Code shall have a continuation account established\nfor each of its Contracts and Grants (CG) Sub-Fund Groups. A FA can elect to\nalso have continuation accounts assigned to specific organization codes, or\nother account attribute, within each Sub-Fund Group for more detailed\nmonitoring and reporting.  \n  \n2\\. The imposed status and Depository of Funds MUST be the same for both the\naccount and the continuation account. If the account is not subject to fringe\nbenefit charges, the continuation account must also be of the same non-imposed\nstatus on the same Sub-Fund Group Type.  \n  \nD. Assigning Continuation Accounts on Non-Contract & Grants Accounts  \n  \n1\\. Since non-CG accounts are generally not tied to specific funding periods,\nthe accounts might not have expiration dates and as such, will not need\ncontinuation accounts assigned. In the event the function that the account\nrepresents comes to a close, then a continuation account will need to be\nentered.  \n  \n2\\. At a minimum, each FO Code shall have a continuation account established\nfor each of its Fund Group\u2019s applicable Sub-Fund Group Type codes (i.e.\nGeneral, Special, Revolving, etc.) as indicated on the Continuation Account\nAttribute Table. An FA or Chart Manager can elect to also have continuation\naccounts assigned to specific Organization codes, Sub-Fund Groups or other\naccount attributes, within each Sub-Fund Group Type code for more detailed\nmonitoring and reporting.  \n  \n3\\. The imposed status and Depository of Funds MUST be the same for both the\naccount and the continuation account. For example, if the account is not\nsubject to fringe benefit charges, the continuation account must also be of\nthe same non-imposed status on the same Sub-Fund Group Type.  \n  \nE. Identifying Continuation Account Transactions  \n  \n1\\. Transactions that are routed to continuation accounts have a distinct\npattern on the transaction ledger in KFS. The description will read similar to\nthe following:  \n  \nAUTO FR MA20123450001 PO for Supplies (General Ledger)  \nor  \nAUTO FR MA6123456DOE, JOHN Q (Labor Ledger)  \n  \nThe general format is:  \nAUTO FR  \nor  \nAUTO FR  \n  \nNote that there are no spaces between each of the items identified between the\nbrackets.  \n  \n2\\. The Chart Code and Account Number represent the account that should have\nbeen assessed the charge. With this information, the FA can determine how to\nappropriately reallocate the charges.  \n  \nF. Continuation Account Restrictions  \n  \n1\\. Continuation Accounts shall not be assessed charges directly. Transactions\nshould not be knowingly charged to the continuation account. Only transactions\nthat are routed via the KFS Scrubber or KFS expired account replacement\nroutines shall be allowed to assess charges on the continuation accounts.  \n  \n2\\. Budgets shall not be established on continuation accounts. Since charges\nshall not be directly assessed on the continuation account, a budget is not\nnecessary on this account. Note that the absence of a budget will cause the\naccount to have a negative budget balance available when charges are present\non the account.  \n  \nG. Reallocating Continuation Account Transactions  \n  \n1\\. The reallocation of continuation account transactions is different\ndepending on what type of transaction was affected. For both types of\nreallocations, appropriate documentation shall be attached to the respective\ne-Doc which adequately substantiates the reallocation of charges.  \n  \n2\\. Non-labor ledger transactions shall be corrected by the responsible Fiscal\nAdministrator using a General Error Correction (GEC) e-Doc in KFS. The\ncontinuation account transaction description can be used to assist in\ndetermining which account needs to be assessed the charge. The FA shall make\nthe determination regarding which account should be assessed for the\ncontinuation account transaction.  \n  \n3\\. Labor ledger transactions shall be corrected by the responsible Fiscal\nAdministrator using a Salary Transfer (ST) e-Doc in KFS. The continuation\naccount transaction description can be used to assist in determining which\naccount needs to be assessed the charge. The FA shall make the determination\nregarding which account should be assessed for the continuation account\ntransaction.  \n  \nH. Monitoring Continuation Accounts  \n  \nReasonable efforts shall be made to ensure that the balances on the\ncontinuation accounts are at a manageable level to minimize the risk of un-\nallocable and/or unallowable costs.  \n  \nI. Reports  \n  \n1\\. Ad-hoc reports in Jasper shall be used to monitor the status of\ncontinuation and general clearing accounts. The reports show the balances and\ndetailed transactions that are recorded on the accounts.  \n  \n2\\. The reports can be pulled at the university, campus organization level or\nFO Code for a given fiscal period and fiscal year.  \n  \nJ. General Clearing Accounts  \n  \nGeneral clearing accounts are established to accept posting from automated or\nmanual processes when the target account or object code is not yet determined.\nGeneral clearing accounts should have \u201cClearing\u201d in the account name and the\naccount type code should be CLR.  \n  \nBanner and Destiny Clearing \u2013 Transactions are posted to KFS via daily\nelectronic feeds. Subsequent processing clears transactions to appropriate\naccounts and payroll overpayments. Corrections are processed by GAO or FA for\nun-cleared balances.  \n  \nTax Set Off Clearing \u2013 Amounts intercepted from individual state tax refunds\nto settle debt owed to UH. FA to clear balances as appropriate.  \n  \nAccounts Receivable (A/R) Clearing \u2013 Transactions posted via KFS A/R payment\nprocessing. FA to clear balances as appropriate.  \n  \nD-71 Clearing \u2013 Transactions posted via ST eDoc when salary is reclassified\nbetween imposed and non-imposed status accounts. Balances reclassified monthly\nby GAO.  \n  \nCost Share Source Clearing Account \u2013 From FA DI eDocs for cost share to CS0001\nsub-accounts. FA to clear balances as appropriate.  \n  \n  \nK. Responsibilities  \n  \n1\\. FA Responsibilities  \n  \na. FAs shall use the attribute guidelines and table presented in Attachments 1\nand 2 when requesting new or modifying existing continuation accounts.  \n  \nb. Continuation accounts and general clearing accounts shall be monitored on a\nmonthly basis by the FA assigned to the accounts.  \n  \nc. Continuation account transactions should be transferred to the appropriate\nproject account prior to award closeout. All continuation accounts shall be\ncleared at the end of each fiscal year. General clearing accounts should also\nbe cleared or appropriately reconciled at the end of each fiscal year.  \n  \nd. FAs can utilize the Available Balances or Balances by Consolidation queries\nin KFS (under Main Menu \u2013 Balance Inquiries \u2013 General Ledger) or the budget\nstatus in the reporting system to monitor the overall status of the accounts.\nIf the continuation account balances out to $0 on each object code, then the\naccount has been appropriately cleared.  \n  \n2\\. Campus Level Responsibilities  \n  \na. Chart Managers shall monitor new account creations and account\nmodifications to ensure that the appropriate continuation account is assigned\nbased on its Fund Group, Sub-Fund Group Type, imposed/non-imposed status, and\nDepository of Funds.  \n  \nb. Campus level chart managers shall utilize reports to monitor the status of\ntheir respective chart code\u2019s continuation accounts and ensure that the\nresponsible FAs are in compliance with this policy.  \n  \n3\\. System Level Responsibilities  \n  \na. Periodic reviews of reports by system-wide offices ORS is responsible for\nsponsored program accounts, and GAO is responsible for non-sponsored program\naccounts) shall be utilized to ensure compliance.  \n  \nb.

Purpose\n\nTo establish procedures for setting course fees for credit programs and/or\ncourses that are entrepreneurial in nature, delivered via telecommunication\nmethods, or otherwise contracted in accordance with Board of Regents Policy RP\n6.202.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Introduction  \nThis executive policy directs implementation of Board of Regents Policy RP\n6.202 relating to contracted and telecommunication course/program fees which\ndelegates to the President the authority to set course fees for credit\nprograms and/or courses that are entrepreneurial in nature, delivered via\ntelecommunication methods, or otherwise contracted. This executive policy\nprovides guidelines to implement this delegation.  \n  \nNon-credit instruction delivered in-state or out-of-state is not encompassed\nby this policy. Charges for non-credit instruction are promulgated in Board of\nRegents Policy RP 6.203, item \u201cc.(4)\u201d Commercial Enterprises & Other Self-\nSupporting Operations, and further delineated in Board of Regents Policy, RP\n6.203, Attachment 1, item #7.  \n  \nB. Policy Guidelines  \nIn general, special course/program fees requested under this authorization\nshould meet the test of positioning the University of Hawai\u2018i to act quickly\nand charge market-sensitive fees for credit instruction offered to special\npopulations. Other guidelines include the following:  \n  \n1\\. The proposed fee applies to courses or a program to be delivered in in-\nstate or out-of-state under special request, agreement, or contractual\narrangement to a select audience and/or to a select site. Examples may include\na series of credit courses and/or an entire degree program in which enrollment\nis limited to employees of a specific private organization (e.g., a particular\nhospital, bank, school, community group, etc.) or to a specific jurisdiction\noutside Hawai\u2018i.  \n  \n2\\. The proposed fee applies to credit courses and/or programs offered outside\nHawai\u2018i and delivered on-site or by telecommunications.  \n  \n3\\. Proposed credit course fees should reflect cost recovery unless a specific\ngeneral fund subsidy is available. The proposed fee always includes applicable\nresident tuition and may reflect additional instructional and course or\nprogram costs such as the following:  \n  \na. Salary of faculty or other professionals providing instruction or service;\nhonoraria for resource people and professionals;  \n  \nb. Program and course development costs;  \n  \nc. Costs associated with telecommunications delivery;  \n  \nd. Student support service costs (e.g., registration, record keeping and\nreporting, financial assistance, etc.);  \n  \ne. Academic support costs (e.g., library, advising, mentoring, counseling,\netc.);  \n  \nf. Institutional support including general administration and technology costs\n(e.g., promotional brochures, mailing, and advertising; cashiering and\naccounting; computers, telecommunications technology, and transmission costs;\netc.);  \n  \ng. Facilities costs;  \n  \nh. Other costs required to deliver the course/program.  \n  \n4\\. For courses and programs offered outside of Hawai\u2018i, the combination of\nresident tuition and the course fee applies instead of nonresident tuition.  \n  \n5\\. The credit courses and/or programs for which special fees are requested\nare established in accordance with campus requirements directing course\napproval and Board of Regents requirements directing the establishment of new\ndegree programs (see Executive Policy EP 5.201 Approval of New Academic\nPrograms and Review of Provisional Academic Programs). Further, courses and\nprograms delivered across geographical distances or through innovative\ndelivery methods may require prior approval by the Western Association of\nSchools and Colleges.  \n  \n6\\. The special credit course/program fees permitted within this policy do not\nreplace nor supplement Board of Regents approved tuition schedules for general\nstudent populations. For example, a universal charge applicable to all regular\nstudents majoring or enrolling in a field of study is not within the scope of\nthe delegation set forth in BOR Policy RP6.202. Requests for such program-\nspecific tuition schedules (e.g., Law, Medical, or Nursing Schools) must be\nproposed and established in accordance with Board and Executive Policy\ndirecting tuition setting for the general student body (see Board of Regents\nPolicy RP 6.201, 6.202, and Executive Policy EP 6.202 Tuition Setting\nProcedures). Also, student and related special service fees and charges\nestablished within the authority of Board of Regents Policy RP 6.203 are\nrequested and authorized separately.  \n  \nC. Format For Requesting Special Credit Course/Program Fees  \nRequests for the special fees outlined above are forwarded through usual line\ncampus officers (provosts/deans, and senior vice presidents) for final\napproval by the President. Proposals should include at least the following\ninformation:  \n  \n1\\. Department/Program/College requesting the fee.  \n  \n2\\. The target student population.  \n  \n3\\. The total fee requested including a breakdown for resident tuition and\nadditional fees.  \n  \n4\\. The date at which and duration for which the fee will be activated.  \n  \n5\\. A description of the course/program to which the special fee will apply\nand a statement of the intended use of the special fee revenues.  \n  \n6\\. Any memorandum of understanding, contract, or agreement established by the\ndate of the special fee request submission or drafts of such documents\nintended to be arranged thereafter should be provided as supporting documents.  \n  \nD. Reporting  \n  \nThe major University Units (UH Manoa, UH Hilo, UH-West O'ahu, and the UH\nCommunity Colleges) forward to the President by July 1 of each year a report\non the headcount enrollment of students served in courses or programs for\nwhich special fees were requested and established, the location of the\ncourse/programs, and overall revenues received.  \n\n##  IV.

(TouchNet)) secure, PCI DSS compliant, hosted eCommerce management system that supports payment processing for a variety of eCommerce applications. Merchant departments shall use the designated eCommerce system, unless an exception is granted.  \n\n          1. Exceptions may be granted if:  \n\n            1. TouchNet cannot meet the business needs of the merchant\n  \n\n            2. The alternate system is in compliance with PCI DSS.\n  \n\n            3. The alternate system must be able to process credit card transactions utilizing the Contractor\u2019s processor (i.e. FISERV (FKA First Data)).\n  \n\n            4. The information about the proposed alternate system must be included on the Credit Card Administration \u2013 Participation and Change Request Form.\n  \n\n          2. Departments granted an exception to use an alternate system will be responsible for any costs to operate and maintain the system.\n          3. Departments granted such exceptions also assume all responsibility and liability for the security of all transactions and data, including any monetary loss suffered by the University due to theft or improper use of credit card numbers and data breach remediation costs from failure to comply with PCI DSS.\n  \n\n        2. The Credit Card Administration \u2013 Participation and Change Request Form must be signed by the Merchant Account Contact, merchant department IT contact, fiscal administrator, and Dean/Director or Department Head.\n  \n\n        3. Once approved, the Treasury Office will submit the request to the Contractor for MID application process.\n  \n\n        4. Contractor will provide MID once application is approved.\n  \n\n        5. Departments are prohibited from contracting directly for credit card services from the Contractor or any other entity.\n  \n\n###\n\n  3. Receipting, Recording and Reconciling  \n\n    1. Refer to Administrative Procedure 8.701, Receipting and Depositing Funds Received by the University, Section III.E. for procedures on receipting, recording and reconciling credit card transactions.\n  \n\n###\n\n  4. Responding to Dispute Notifications  \n\n    1. Should a cardholder dispute a credit card transaction, a dispute notice will be provided to the merchant\u2019s fiscal administrator.\n  \n\n    2. A response must be submitted by the merchant for all dispute notifications to the processor as directed on the chargeback notice.\n  \n\n    3. The merchant will receive an invoice from the Contractor for the chargeback amount, regardless of the outcome of the dispute decision. The merchant shall promptly process payment to the Contractor.\n  \n\n    4. Should the dispute be decided in favor of the University and the chargeback reversed, the UH Treasury Office will notify the merchant contact and the merchant will record the receipt of the funds in the University\u2019s financial system. \n  \n\n###\n\n  5. Procedures to Close Merchant Account  \n\n    1. Submit written request to the Treasury Office to close merchant account, including reason to close account.\n  \n\n    2. Upon approval, the UH Treasury Office shall coordinate the closing procedures with merchant department and Contractor.\n  \n\n    3. Any equipment obtained from the Contractor must be promptly returned.\n  \n\n###\n\n  6. University PCI DSS Compliance Process  \n\n    1. Background  \n\n      1. The PCI SSC set forth PCI DSS, a set of twelve technical and operational requirements to protect cardholder data and reduce credit card fraud. \n  \n\n      2. The PCI DSS requirements apply to all organizations that store, process or transmit credit card data, thus, as such an organization, the University is required to comply with PCI DSS.\n  \n\n      3. Each University Merchant is required to comply with University policies and procedures and the applicable PCI DSS requirements based on their payment processing method/merchant environment.\n  \n\n      4. University policies and procedures and PCI DSS requirements apply to all University Merchant personnel involved with University merchant operations that could affect the security of cardholder data.  \n\n  \n\n    2. The SAQ is an annual PCI-mandated attestation intended to demonstrate compliance with PCI DSS. Depending on the payment processing method/ merchant environment, a specific set of PCI DSS requirements are applicable and are detailed in the applicable SAQ. Failure to meet the PCI DSS requirements may increase exposure to fraudulent activity. In addition, failure of the Merchant Account Contact to submit the SAQ on an annual basis will cause the University to be out of compliance.   \n  \nDescriptions for each SAQ type are provided below: | **SAQ Type**| **Description**  \n---|---  \n**A**|  Card not present (eCommerce) merchants that have fully outsourced all\ncardholder data functions to PCI DSS compliant third-party service providers\nwith no electronic storage, processing, or transmission of any cardholder data\non the merchant\u2019s systems or premise. This SAQ is applicable for the\nUniversity merchants utilizing TouchNet.  \n**A-EP**|  eCommerce merchant who outsources all payment processing to a PCI\nDSS validated third party, but whose website may impact the security of the\npayment transaction. No electronic storage, processing or transmission of\ncardholder data on merchant\u2019s systems or premises.  \n**B**|  Card-present merchant that uses a standalone dial-out terminal (analog\nphone line) to process credit cards or imprint machines; no electronic\ncardholder data storage.  \n**B-IP**|  Merchants using only standalone, PIN Transaction Security (PTS)\napproved payment terminals with an Internet Protocol (IP) connection to the\npayment processor with no electronic cardholder data storage. This includes\ncard-present machine that uses a standalone dial-out terminal via cellular\nphone line connection.  \n**C**|  Merchants with payment application systems connected to the Internet,\nno electronic cardholder data storage.  \n**C-VT**|  Merchants that manually enter a single transaction at a time via\nkeyboard into an internet-based virtual terminal solution that is provided and\nhosted by a PCI-DSS validated third-party service provided. The terminal used\nshall only process payments. No electronic cardholder data storage.  \n**P2PE**|  Merchants using only hardware payment terminals included in and\nmanaged via a validated, PCI SSC-listed Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)\nsolution (the P2PE solution must be listed at:\nhttps://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/point_to_point_encryption_solutions)\nwith no electronic cardholder data storage.  \n**D**|  All merchants not included in descriptions for the above SAQ types.\nApplies to merchants that electronically store cardholder data. Electronic\nstorage of cardholder data is not allowed at the University.  \n  \n\n    3. PCI DSS Requirements  \n\n      1. PCI DSS is comprised of 6 primary goals with 12 requirements. These goals and requirements were designed to ensure safe-handling of sensitive information related to credit card transactions. The goals and requirements are listed below. To see the complete PCI DSS requirements and additional information on PCI DSS, see the PCI SSC website at: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/  \n\n  \n_Goal - Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems_  \n**\n\n      2. Requirement #1 \u2013 Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data\n**  \nFirewalls are devices that control computer traffic allowed between the\nUniversity\u2019s networks (internal) and untrusted networks (external), as well as\ntraffic into and out of more sensitive areas within an entity\u2019s internal\ntrusted networks. The cardholder data environment is an example of a more\nsensitive area within an entity\u2019s trusted network. A firewall examines all\nnetwork traffic and blocks those transmissions that do not meet the\nUniversity\u2019s specified security criteria.  \n  \nAll systems must be protected from unauthorized access from untrusted\nnetworks, whether entering the system via the Internet as e-commerce, employee\nInternet access through desktop browsers, employee e-mail access, dedicated\nconnections such as business-to-business connections, via wireless networks,\nor via other sources. Often, seemingly insignificant paths to and from\nuntrusted networks can provide unprotected pathways into key systems.\nFirewalls are a key protection mechanism for any computer network.  \n  \nOther system components may provide firewall functionality, as long as they\nmeet the minimum requirements for firewalls as defined in this requirement.\nWhere other system components are used within the cardholder data environment\nto provide firewall functionality, these devices must be included within the\nscope and assessment of requirement 1.\n\n  \n\n    4. **Requirement # 2- Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters**  \nSystem components used in sensitive networks often will come with default\nvendor settings (usernames, passwords, configuration settings, etc.). Vendor-\nsupplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters must be\nchanged before systems are installed in the secure network environment\n(cardholder data network).  \n  \nIndividuals with malicious intent (external and internal to an entity) often\nuse vendor default passwords and other vendor default settings to compromise\nsystems. These passwords and settings are well known by hacker communities and\nare easily determined via public information.\n\n  \n_Goal - Protect Cardholder Data_  \n\n    5. **Requirement #3 \u2013 Protect cardholder data**  \nAll cardholder data must be securely handled and protected against\nunauthorized use at all times.  \n  \nCardholder data is defined as:  \n\u2022 Primary Account Number (PAN)  \n\u2022 Card Validation Code (CVV, CVV2, and CVC2)  \n\u2022 Credit Card Personal Identification Number (PIN)  \n\u2022 Any form of magnetic stripe data from the card (Track 1, Track 2)  \n  \nIt is strictly prohibited to store:  \n\u2022 The contents of the payment card magnetic stripe (track data) on any media  \n\u2022 The PIN or CVV/CVC on any media  \n  \nPAN is to be masked when displayed (first six and last four digits are the\nmaximum number of digits to be displayed). Access to sensitive cardholder\ninformation such as PANs is restricted to employees that have a legitimate\nneed to view such information.  \n  \nCardholder data must be protected when stored or in transit over public (or\nuntrusted) networks. Strong industry standard encryption methodologies must be\nused to protect data stored on hard drives, removable media, backups, etc.  \n  \nProtection methods such as encryption, truncation, masking, and hashing are\ncritical components of cardholder data protection. If an intruder circumvents\nother network security controls and gains access to encrypted data, without\nthe proper cryptographic keys, the sensitive data is unreadable and unusable\nto that person.  \n  \nAny sensitive cardholder data that is no longer required for business reasons\nmust be discarded in a secure and irrecoverable manner.\n\n  \n\n    6. **Requirement #4 \u2013 Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks**  \nCardholder data must be encrypted during transmission over networks that are\neasily accessed by malicious individuals. Misconfigured wireless networks and\nvulnerabilities in legacy encryption and authentication protocols continue to\nbe targets of malicious individuals who exploit these vulnerabilities to gain\nprivileged access to cardholder data environments.  \n\n  \n_Goal - Maintain a Vulnerability Program_  \n\n    7. **Requirement #5 \u2013 Protect all systems against malware and regularly update anti-virus software or programs**  \nSystem components within the cardholder data network must be part of an active\nvulnerability maintenance program. This program will control the existence of\nmalicious software (e.g., anti-virus software) and provide policies covering\ndevelopment efforts and system or software updates/upgrades such that security\nis maintained.  \n  \nMalicious software, commonly referred to as \u201cmalware\u201d\u2014including viruses,\nworms, and Trojans\u2014enters a sensitive network segment during many business\napproved activities, including employees\u2019 e-mail and use of the Internet,\nmobile computers, and storage devices, resulting in the exploitation of system\nvulnerabilities. Anti-virus software must be used on all systems commonly\naffected by malware to protect systems from current and evolving malicious\nsoftware threats.\n\n  \n\n    8. **Requirement #6 \u2013 Develop and maintain secure systems and applications**  \nUnscrupulous individuals use security vulnerabilities to gain privileged\naccess to systems. Many of these vulnerabilities are fixed by vendor-provided\nsecurity patches, which must be installed by the entities that manage the\nsystems. All systems must have all appropriate software patches to protect\nagainst the exploitation and compromise of cardholder data by malicious\nindividuals and malicious software.  \n  \nNote: Appropriate software patches are those patches that have been evaluated\nand tested sufficiently to determine that the patches do not conflict with\nexisting security configurations.\n\n  \n_Goal - Implement Strong Access Control Measures_  \n\n    9. **Requirement #7 \u2013 Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know**  \nAccess to system components and software within the cardholder data network\nmust be controlled and restricted to those with a business need for that\naccess. This is achieved using active access control systems, strong controls\non user and password management, and restricting physical access to critical\nor sensitive components and software to individuals with a \u201cneed to know.\u201d  \n  \nSystems and processes must be in place to limit access to critical data and\nsystems based on an individual\u2019s need to know and according to job\nresponsibilities.  \n  \nNeed to know is when access rights are granted to the least amount of data and\nprivileges needed to perform a job.\n\n  \n\n    10. **Requirement #8 - Identify and authenticate access to system components**  \nIt is critical to assign a unique identification (ID) to each person with\naccess to critical systems or software. This ensures that each individual is\nuniquely accountable for his or her actions. When such accountability is in\nplace, actions taken on critical data and systems are performed by, and can be\ntraced to, known and authorized users.\n\n  \n\n    11. **Requirement #9 \u2013 Restrict physical access to cardholder data**  \nMedia is defined as any printed or handwritten paper, received faxes, external\nstorage or back-up tapes, computer hard drive, etc. Media containing sensitive\ncardholder information must be handled and distributed in a secure manner.\nStrict control must be maintained over the external or internal distribution\nof any media containing cardholder data and over the storage and accessibility\nof media. The transportation of media containing sensitive cardholder data to\nanother location must be authorized by appropriate personnel, logged and\ninventoried before leaving the premises.  \n  \nAny physical access to data or systems that house cardholder data provide the\nopportunity for individuals to access devices or data and to remove systems or\nhardcopies, and should be appropriately restricted.  \n  \nVisitors must always be escorted by an employee in areas that hold sensitive\ncardholder information.  \n  \nDisposal of cardholder data:  \n\n      1. All data must be securely disposed of when no longer required, regardless of the media on which it is stored\n  \n\n      2. Hard copy materials must be crosscut shredded or incinerated such that they cannot be reconstructed\n  \n\n      3. All cardholder data on electronic media must be rendered unrecoverable when deleted\n  \n\n      4. All cardholder information awaiting destruction must be held in lockable storage containers and access to these containers must be restricted\n  \n_Goal - Regularly Monitor and Test Networks_  \n\n    12. **Requirement #10 \u2013 Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data**  \nLogging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in\npreventing, detecting, or minimizing the impact of a data compromise. The\npresence of logs in all environments allows thorough tracking, alerting, and\nanalysis when something does go wrong. Determining the cause of a compromise\nis very difficult without system activity logs. Detailed monitoring procedures\nshould be developed and documented.\n\n  \n**\n\n    13. Requirement #11 \u2013 Regularly test security systems and processes\n**  \nVulnerabilities are continually being discovered in current, and introduced by\nnew software. System components, processes, and custom software must be tested\nfrequently to ensure security controls continue to reflect a changing\nenvironment. Detailed testing procedure should be developed and documented.\n\n  \n_Goal - Maintain an Information Security Policy_  \n**\n\n  7. Requirement #12 \u2013 Maintain a policy that addresses information security for all personnel\n**  \nConsistent policies and procedures are required to be practiced and followed\nat all times.  \n  \nAll employees should be aware of the sensitivity of data and their\nresponsibilities for protecting it. The University\u2019s information security\npolicy and procedures apply to all employees (full-time, part-time, casual\nhires, student employees) and others (i.e. volunteers) that work within the\nUniversity\u2019s cardholder data environment.  \n  \nIf cardholder data is shared with a 3rd party Service Provider:  \n\u2022 A list of such Service Providers must be maintained.  \n\u2022 There shall be a written agreement with the Service Provider.  \n\u2022 The Service Provider shall be monitored for PCI DSS compliance.  \n  \nIf a merchant department believes it may have a breach of cardholder\ninformation or of systems related to the PCI environment, refer to Appendix C\nfor University\u2019s PCI Incident Response Plan Guidelines.\n\n  \n\n* Applicable University Policies   \n\n  1. The Information Security Governance Leadership Group ensures that all information security policies, procedures and other initiatives are implemented and maintained within their authorities.\n  \n\n  2. University policies related to Information Security are available at https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/policies/ and include the following, but are not limited to:  \nEP 2.210 \u2013 Use and Management of Information Technology Resources Policy\n\n  \n\n  3. EP 2.214 \u2013 Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines  \n\n    1. Credit card information is categorized as \u201cRegulated.\u201d This means that inadvertent disclosures or inappropriate access requires breach notification in accordance with HRS \u00a7487N and is subject to financial fines.\n  \n\n  4. Refer to ITS Minimum Security Standards at   \nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/minimum-standards/ and EP 2.215 \u2013 UH\nInstitutional Data Governance Policy\n\n  \n\n  5.

PCI DSS \u2013 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/\n\n  \n\n* The University\u2019s policies and procedures related to the University\u2019s PCI DSS compliance process is reviewed at least annually. Merchant departments that establish supplemental procedures for their departments should annually review their procedures to reflect changes to business objectives or risk environment. \n  \n\n* All University personnel involved in credit card operations (i.e. access to credit card information or involved with credit card systems or processing credit card transactions) must complete the Information Security Policy Acknowledgment online via the Acknowledgments and Certifications (ACER) Service (https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/) form on an annual basis.\n  \n\n* Merchant PCI DSS Compliance Process  \n\n  1. The Merchant determines the applicable SAQ type required for the MID based on the payment processing method/merchant environment as described in the table in Section F.2. above. Whenever there is a change in the merchant\u2019s processing method or environment, the Merchant Account Contact must complete the Credit Card Administration \u2013 Participation and Change Request Form before any change is implemented, and the merchant\u2019s SAQ type should be re-evaluated. The SAQ type will govern the PCI DSS requirements applicable to the Merchant.\n  \n\n  2. At least annually, or whenever there is a change in the Merchant\u2019s processing method or environment, the Merchant Account Contact shall review compliance with PCI DSS and University requirements. \n  \n\n  3. To provide Merchant Departments with assistance on technical requirements, refer to the UH ITS PCI Technical Guidelines document (Appendix A).\n  \n\n  4. The Merchant Account Contact shall compile and maintain documentation to support applicable PCI DSS compliance. \n  \n\n  5. All merchants must be compliant with PCI DSS. Any non-complying requirements identified must be remediated or brought to the attention of the UH Treasury Office for assistance in resolution. \n  \n\n  6. On an annual basis, each Merchant Account Contact shall complete the SAQ and attestation.\n  \n\n  7. The Treasury Office and/or ITS Information Security may request information to review and validate SAQ responses. Required PCI DSS supporting documents shall be maintained and may be requested in this validation process.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n##  IV.

The chair is responsible to the dean of the college for the following\nfunctions as they apply to the department: providing the courses required by\nthe curricula of the various colleges; preparation of the department budget;\nexpenditure of funds allocated to the department; recommendations for\nreappointments and for appointments to unfilled positions; recommendations for\npromotions; rating of faculty members not on permanent tenure; assignment of\ncourses and proper departmental balance of teaching load; textbook orders;\nsupervision of instruction; direction of graduate assistants; assistance with\nregistration during both the academic year and the summer session; improvement\nof instruction and encouragement of research; implementing University rules\nlimiting \"overload\" teaching and other compensated work.  \n  \nb. In some colleges, some or all of these functions are consolidated in the\noffice of the Dean.  \n  \nc.

Appointment of a department chair at the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa\nshall be made in accordance with the following procedure  \n  \ne. Only persons with the rank of associate professor or of professor are\nnormally eligible for the chair. If no one in these ranks is available, a\nmember of a lower rank, or some appropriate person elsewhere in the College,\nis appointed as acting chair.  \n  \nf.

The deans' consultation with faculty members prior to recommendations on\ndepartment chair may take a variety of forms depending upon such factors as\nthe size of department, formal structure and internal relationships.

Appointments are usually announced in the early spring. Department chair\nare normally appointed for three-year terms, although appointments for shorter\nterms are made when necessary. Reappointment of a chair at the end of a term,\nas the appointment of a new chair, is preceded by a dean's consultation with\nfaculty members as set forth above.  \n  \ni. Faculty personnel appointed to serve as department chair may receive\nadditional compensation in the form of released time from regular faculty\nresponsibilities and/or change from 9 to 11-month appointments and/or monthly\nstipends.

Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. In keeping with its established purpose as the state\u2019s sole public\nuniversity, the university strives to provide quality education and training\nto meet state needs and provide postsecondary access and opportunity for the\npeople of Hawai\u2018i. To achieve these ends, the university is committed to a\nvigorous distance education effort and offsite instruction.  \n  \nB. Distance education is instruction delivered synchronously or asynchronously\nusing one or more technologies that support regular and substantive\ninteraction between students who are separated from the instructor.  \n  \nC. Offsite instruction is instruction offered at a location off campus in\nwhich there is direct contact between students and faculty.  \n  \nD. The university\u2019s on-going goal shall be to offer distance education and\noffsite instruction in Hawai\u2018i at a cost to the student similar to charges for\nregular on-campus instruction. Applicable nonresident tuition applies unless\nsuperseded or supplemented by special credit course or other fees approved by\nthe president.  \n  \nE. Responsibility for Distance Education and Offsite Instruction  \n  \n1\\. A fundamental requirement for distance education is that the quality and\nstandards of such courses and programs be comparable in rigor and breadth to\nsimilar on campus instructional programs of the university and focus on\nstudent outcomes. It is the responsibility of faculty to establish or approve\nstandards that apply to all instructional programs of their campus, and to\napply those standards to on- and off-campus programs in the process of program\nreview.  \n  \n2\\. It is the responsibility of the university and campus administration to\nensure that distance programs are consistent with institutional role and\nmission; that there is a planning and evaluation process and academic\noversight; that the technology infrastructure and services and associated\nfaculty support are adequate to enable instructional quality; and that there\nare appropriate processes for verification of student identity. In addition,\ndistant/offsite learners have comparable access to campus services including\nbut not limited to admissions, orientation, financial aid, registration,\nadvisement, tutoring, and library services.  \n\n##  IV.

Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to advance the University of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s (UH)\nmission of extending access to higher education throughout the State of\nHawai\u2018i, enhance educational services to UH students, and reach new\nconstituencies throughout the world. This executive policy is promulgated in\naccordance with the authority delegated to the President by the Board of\nRegents. The provisions of this policy are designed to carry out the intent of\nthe Board of Regents\u2019 policy to expand access to quality higher educational\nopportunities to Hawai\u2018i citizens (Board of Regents Bylaws and Policies,\nSection 5-10).  \n  \nThe primary purpose for distance learning at UH is to provide increased access\nto post-secondary education to the residents of the State of Hawai\u2018i. Distance\nlearning is also an important enabler of the entrepreneurial goals of the\nUniversity and can support the University\u2019s mission beyond the boundaries of\nthe State.  \n  \nOnline learning is a powerful and flexible enabler of distance learning. In\naddition to breaking down barriers of distance, online learning can break down\nbarriers of time that prevent some students from attending courses on\nscheduled days and times. Online learning is also an important educational\nelement for campus-based students who may take fully online courses alongside\nclassroom-based courses and hybrid courses that combine classroom and online\nactivities. Online learning can provide high-quality opportunities for\nindividualization of learning and increased student engagement. In addition,\nonline learning can help UH address limited resource constraints such as\nclassrooms and parking, can enable campuses to aggregate demand for courses\nfor which there is insufficient enrollment to justify offerings on multiple\ncampuses. Online learning offers opportunities for affordably increasing high\nquality educational opportunities for students.  \n  \nUH takes a holistic approach to distance and online learning through which we\nleverage and integrate our campus based practices and capabilities with our\ndistance and online practices and capabilities. UH distance and online courses\nare taught by UH faculty hired through the normal faculty processes and UH\ndistance and online programs award regular UH campus credentials. Distance and\nonline learning is largely \u201cmainstreamed\u201d at UH, i.e., standard campus\nacademic and administrative processes support distance and online endeavors.\nThe \u201canywhere and anytime\u201d technologies used in distance and online education\nat UH also support classroom-based instruction, meetings, and collaboration\namong UH faculty and staff throughout the UH System and with colleagues\nelsewhere. Distance and online learning may be applicable at any level and may\nbe for credit or non-credit.  \n  \n\n##  II. Guiding Principles for Distance and Online Learning\n\n  \nThe fundamental policy principles for University of Hawai\u2018i distance and\nonline learning are:  \n  \n**A. Everyone\u2019s Responsibility:** Distance and online learning and support are\nan integral part of the University\u2019s mission and a responsibility of every\ncampus and support unit throughout the UH System. In addition, every unit on\nevery campus needs to embrace their responsibilities to fully support and\nembrace distance and online learning and distance learners alongside\nclassroom-based instruction and campus-based learners. This includes not only\ninstructional delivery but also academic support, student support, and\nadministrative and other support services.  \n  \n**B. Quality:** Distance and online learning is first and foremost an academic\nendeavor. The quality and standards of distance and online instruction,\nwhether involving synchronous or asynchronous interaction, must be comparable\nto those for traditional instructional programs activities with at least\ncomparable assessment practices. Regardless of any collaborative arrangements,\nthe responsibility for quality assurance resides firmly with the campus\nconferring the credit and/or credential.  \n  \n**C. All UH Students are \u201cOur\u201d Students:** UH campuses and education centers\nsupport all UH distance learning students as their own, including those\nmatriculating at other campuses. If a distance learning program is a joint\neffort among campuses, it is the responsibility of the supporting sites to\nprovide for the legitimate needs of the students physically on their campus,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the degree or certificate the student is\npursuing will be conferred by a sister campus.  \n  \n**D. Collaboration:** Distance learning within the UH System is a\ncollaborative enterprise across all aspects of the academic environment\nincluding program planning, curriculum development and delivery, student\nservices and other support services (such as testing centers). If needed,\nmemoranda of agreement detail the responsibilities of originating and\nsupporting sites including addressing specific cases in which financial\nsupport may be required from originating campuses. Collaboration with external\nproviders may be considered when internal resources are not available to\nrespond to demonstrated in-state needs.  \n  \n**E. Accreditation:** For distance learning programs within Hawai\u2018i campuses\nand support units must work together to ensure that accreditation standards\nare met. The responsibility for meeting accreditation standards for distance\nand online learning programs rests firmly with the campus bestowing the degree\nor certificate. Responsibility for supporting in-state distance learning\nstudents may be shared among an originating campus and other supporting sites,\ni.e., campuses and education centers where student may participate in\nsynchronous interactive sessions and/or receive assistance and support.  \n  \n**F. Tuition and Fees:** In accord with BOR Policy [5-10(d)], distance\nlearning credit instruction is offered in Hawai\u2018i at a cost to residents\nsimilar to that of regular on-campus instruction. Special provisions of BOR\nPolicy [6-2(g)] enable special tuition rates for distance learning programs\ndelivered entirely by telecommunications outside the State or to specific\npopulations, generally on an entrepreneurial or externally-supported basis.  \n  \nStudents in distance and online programs need to be recognized as members of\nthe student body of the offering campus including having access to co-\ncurricular and fee-based services. However, distance learning students who\nhave no opportunity to benefit from certain on-campus fees may have those fees\nwaived or may be charged substitute fees that support unique requirements of\ndistant learners (BOR Policy 6-3.b.2.ii). The new Executive Policy EP 6.208,\nrecognizes the fee considerations for distance and online students.  \n  \n**G. Broad Technology Applicability:** When deploying technologies to support\ndistance learning, the University strives to select and invest in technologies\nthat have broad applicability to support campus-based learners and to general\ncollaboration within academic communities as well.  \n  \n**H. Accessibility:** In accord with applicable statutes and regulations,\nreasonable accommodations will be made to facilitate access to UH distance\nlearning programs and services by all qualified students with disabilities.\nAlthough distance learning often breaks down traditional barriers of time and\nspace, technological advances may also place new and unforeseen demands on\neducational services and support. Originating and supporting sites, along with\ntheir respective disability service programs, will cooperate to provide\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services to those with documented disabilities.  \n  \n**I. Copyright:** The University is committed to full compliance with\ncopyright laws in its adoption and utilization of software and content for\ndistance and online learning.  \n  \n\n##  III. Distance Learning Roles & Responsibilities\n\nEffective and efficient delivery of distance and online programs across the\nState of Hawai\u2018i requires collaboration among campuses, education centers and\nsupport units. Even fully online programs inevitably demand the support of\nother UH units of when enrolling students on other islands of the State. The\nfollow sections outline the responsibilities of units that deliver programs,\nunits that support programs from other campuses, the UH System, and specific\ncoordinating entities.  \n  \n**A. Campuses that originate programs and courses:**  \n  \n\n  1. Have primary responsibility for delivery of programs & courses and the implementation of appropriate instructional materials and methods. Each campus establishes its own internal processes for assuring the quality and integrity of all distance learning curricula and meeting all applicable accreditation requirements.   \n\n  2. Commitment to all necessary support for a period sufficient to enable current students to complete their degrees/certificates.  \n\n  3. Commit to providing accurate and complete information about courses and programs, including entering all course and program data into all applicable university information systems.  \n\n  4. Collaborate with supporting sites regarding program plans, support needs and requirements. \n\n  \n  \n**B. Supporting sites:**  \n  \n\n  1. Provide information to students in their areas of responsibility who are interested and qualified for programs and courses in collaboration with the campuses offering programs.  \n\n  2. Collaborate with originating campuses to ensure adequate support services to enable students to complete degrees/certificates in a timely manner.  \n\n  3. University and Education Centers regularly assess community needs within their areas of responsibility and communicate the results of those assessments throughout the UH System.\n\n  \n  \n**C. System Offices:**  \n  \n\n  1. Facilitate coordination among campuses and units supporting distance learning, including the creation and convening of standing and ad-hoc working groups and advisory councils.  \n\n  2. Manage the UH System technology infrastructure and services to support distance and online learning activities.  \n\n  3. Disseminate information regarding applicable federal and state regulations and laws, and best practices in distance and online learning.  \n\n  4. Display course, program, enrollment and related information regarding distance and online learning to communicate opportunities and activities within UH and externally.  \n\n  5. Provide opportunities for system-wide faculty and staff development in distance and online learning.  \n\n  6. Assist in the acquisition of resources for development of distance learning programs. \n\n  \n  \n**D. Specific Distance Learning Coordinating Entities:**  \n  \nCoordination of collaborative distance learning throughout the UH System\nrequires the active collaboration among inter-campus and cross-functional\nworking groups and advisory councils. Establishing effective lines of\ncommunication across these \u201ccommunities of practice\u201d is essential to the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s overall decentralized approach, mainstreamed and\ncollaborative approach to distance learning.  \n  \n**1\\. Distance Learning Advisory Council (DLAC)** is the lead system-wide\ngroup that helps the University of Hawai\u2018i advance its mission through\ndistance and online learning. The DLAC is responsible to recommend policies\nand to proactively identify and catalyze action on systemic issues as they\narise. As appropriate, the DLAC counsels University administrators and policy-\nmakers through such groups as the Council of Chancellors, the Council of Chief\nAcademic Officer, and the Council of Chief Student Affairs Officers. The DLAC\nprepares, monitors and oversees a system-wide distance and online learning\naction plan that advances overall institutional plans and priorities of the UH\nsystem and the campuses (http://www.hawaii.edu/dlplan). The DLAC is convened\nand chaired jointly by the offices of the Vice President for Academic Policy\nand Planning and Vice President for Information Technology/Chief Information\nOfficer.  \n  \n**2\\. Distance Learning Program Planning Group (DLPPG)** is a system-wide\ngroup composed of University and Education Centers and representation from\noffering units that assists campuses, departments and support units in the\nplanning and coordination of distance and online programs to meet educational\nneeds within the State of Hawai\u2018i. The DLPPG advises programs, allocates\nsystem resources, and coordinates the master listings of distance and online\nprograms. The DLPPG is convened and chaired by the Director of Academic\nTechnologies.  \n  \n**3\\. Campus Distance Coordinators (CDC)** is a system-wide group that is\nresponsible for addressing student, faculty, and staff concerns relating to\ndistance learning at the operational level. This group helps identify system-\nwide issues and raises them to the attention of the DLAC. The CDC is convened\nand chaired by election from within the CDC membership.  \n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo provide guidance on establishing and maintaining University account codes\n(accounts).  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nAccount \u2013 The account code is a seven (7) character code representing a\nfunctional unit established for a specific purpose with one individual having\nprimary responsibility for it. It monitors the financial activities for a\nfunctional unit.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. General Guidelines  \n  \n1\\. An account represents the smallest unit of activity or lowest level of\nresponsibility at which accounting data is collected and maintained. It is\nrequired with each accounting transaction and is used to analyze data for\nvarious levels of financial reporting.  \n  \n2\\. New accounts shall be established whenever separate accounting and\nreporting are required for legal, organizational, or functional reasons.\nAccounts shall not be established for record-keeping purposes which can be\naccomplished by the proper use of object codes (see AP 8.615).  \n  \n3\\. Advance accounts for extramurally funded research and training projects\nmay be created when authorized according to AP 8.952.  \n  \n4\\. New appropriation codes shall be coordinated with the General Accounting\nand Loan Collection (GALC) office.  \n  \nB. Establishment of Accounts  \n  \nThe following applies to non-extramural accounts. For information on setting\nup extramural accounts, please contact the Office of Research Services (ORS).  \n  \n1\\. To establish a new account, either copy an existing account or create a\nnew account in KFS. This will create a new electronic document (edoc).  \n  \n2\\. Enter an appropriate Description and Explanation.  \n  \na. The Description should start with your three (3) digit FO code (e.g. 036\nCreate new RTRF account)  \n  \n3\\. In the Account Number field, use the following convention to create a\n\u201cdummy\u201d account number:  \n  \na. Sub-Fund Group Type Code (1 character) + FO Code (3 digits) + discretionary\nsequence number (3 digits)  \n  \nb. The resulting account number should consist of seven (7) characters  \n  \nc. The Sub-Fund Group Type Codes can be found in KFS (e.g. A = Agency, B =\nBond, F = Federal, G = General, P = UH Trust, R = Revolving, S = Special)  \n  \nd. The discretionary sequence number is a number assigned by the preparer to\nkeep track of their new accounts internally and can be any three (3) digit\nnumber  \n  \ne. Example of a dummy account number for a new revolving fund account\nestablished by FA 036: R036001  \n  \n4\\. Enter or revise the remaining attributes of the new account. Ensure that\nthe proper attributes are being used for the account (i.e. correct Higher\nEducation Function Code, Revenue Function Code, Sub-Fund Group Code, UH Fund-\nAppropriation, etc.).  \n  \na. Ensure that the Sub-Fund Group Code and the UH Fund-Appropriation are\nconsistent (e.g. an account with Sub-Fund Group Code \u201cSOTHER\u201d should have a UH\nFund-Appropriation that starts with an \u201cS\u201d)  \n  \n5\\. Ensure that the edoc will route to the appropriate campus budget office.\nIf the campus budget office is not automatically included in the routing,\nadhoc (approve) route the edoc to them.  \n  \n6\\. Once the edoc is submitted by the preparer, it will route to the following\nfor review and approval:  \n  \na. Campus budget office  \n  \nb. KFS campus chart manager (CC, HI, MA, WO, SW)  \n  \nc. KFS system chart manager (GALC)  \n  \n7\\. The KFS system chart manager in GALC removes the dummy account number and\nassigns a permanent account number. The master list of new accounts (with the\nexception of extramural accounts maintained by ORS) is maintained by GALC.  \n  \n8\\. The KFS system chart manager in GALC adhoc (FYI) routes the edoc to the\npreparer to inform him/her of the new account number and approves the edoc.\nThis finalizes the new account creation process.  \n  \nC. Maintenance of Accounts  \n  \n1\\. Changes to accounts are initiated in KFS either by editing a single\naccount or by using a global edoc to edit multiple accounts within the same\nchart.  \n  \n2\\. The following account attributes should not be changed without GALC\u2019s\napproval:  \n  \na. Sub-Fund Group Code  \n  \nb. UH Fund-Appropriation  \n  \n3\\. Generally, for an account to be closed in KFS:  \n  \na. There should be no remaining balances in the account  \n  \nb. There should be no current fiscal year transactions in the account  \n  \nc. There should be no prior fiscal year thirteenth (13th) month transactions\nin the account  \n  \nd. An appropriate Continuation Chart of Accounts Code and Continuation Account\nNumber (see AP 8.650) should be used  \n  \n4\\. To reopen a closed account, please contact GALC.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo define centers and provide a consistent structure for their approval and\nreview, this policy is established to implement Board of Regents Bylaws and\nPolicies  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nCenters are umbrella organizational entities that focus efforts, usually\nmulti-disciplinary in nature, to meet special needs or deal with current\nissues. Often centers serve as focal points to emphasize a strategic thrust of\na college, school, or department.  \n  \nCenters covered by this policy operate at an organizational level below that\nof a school or college. This policy does not apply to the establishment of\norganized research units (see EP 5.213), University Centers for distance\neducation (see EP 5.204), or academic programs involving conferral of academic\ncredentials (see EP 5.201), all of which are governed by other Board of\nRegents\u2019 policies.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nThe University of Hawai\u2018i has evolved numerous institutes, centers, offices,\nnon- instructional programs and similar entities. Their purposes and\ncharacteristics vary considerably, ranging from small \u201cletterhead\u201d groups that\ngive identity to an interdisciplinary purpose to large enterprises that\ninvolve major staffing and space commitments. In order to define centers and\nprovide a consistent structure for their approval and review, this policy is\nestablished to implement Board of Regents Bylaws and Policies, RP 5.206.  \n  \nFor the remainder of this document, the term \u201ccenter\u201d will be used to\ndesignate these entities.  \n  \nA. Types of centers. Based on their primary purpose, centers fall into one of\nthe following general categories.  \n  \n1\\. Instruction or research centers have as a major focus activities related\nto the instruction of students or the conduct of research.  \n  \n2\\. Public service centers have as a major focus patient care or activities\nrelated to the dissemination of information or the provision of service to the\ncommunity.  \n  \n3\\. Administrative service centers have as a major focus provision of student\nor institutional support services designed to carry out the administration and\nmanagement of campuses and/or the system as a whole.  \n  \nB. Authorization to Establish Centers. As established in Board of Regents\u2019\npolicy RP 5.206, instructional, research, administrative or public service\ncenters require Board of Regents approval when: (1) the center requires\nsignificant current or future commitments of institutional funding, personnel\nor physical resources, a substantive change in program mission, and/or involve\nmajor institutional liability; (2) the proposed center involves Board or\nPresidential agreements with external governmental or private entities; or (3)\nthe proposed center involves an honorific name in the designation of the\ncenter.  \n  \nAuthorization for centers that do not meet the above criteria is delegated to\neach, Vice President, Chancellor, System-wide Director, and the State Director\nfor Career and Technical Education within their respective units or offices.\nThis authorization may be further delegated.  \n  \nAll centers affiliated with or operating under the auspices of the University\nof Hawai\u2018i are subject to the authorization requirements of this policy.\nCenters that house permanent positions may also be subject to the requirements\nof Administrative Procedures A3.101 University of Hawai\u2018i Organizational and\nFunctional Changes.  \n  \nC. Authorization to Discontinue Centers. Those centers established by the\nBoard of Regents may be discontinued only by action of the Board of Regents.\nOther centers may be discontinued at the level at which they are approved.\nCenters that appear on an organizational chart must follow the procedures of\nAdministrative Policy A3.101.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo (1) define Organized Research Units, (2) to describe their purpose,\nadministration, scope, funding, and faculty, and (3) to acknowledge certain\nexemptions from some of the policy's aspects for certain units.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nAn Organized Research Unit (ORU) is a Board of Regents approved,\nextradepartmental administrative structure which provides a locus for faculty,\nstaff, and students to engage in focused, collaborative research and training\nactivities. Organized Research Units exist at the level of a School or College\n(Level V) and are supported in part by the Organized Research Budget\n(UOH-102).  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nAuthority for the establishment and termination of Organized Research Units\n(ORUs) is vested solely in the Board of Regents of the University of Hawai\u2018i,\nacting upon the recommendation of the President after appropriate review and\nrecommendations by the relevant faculty senate and administrative officers. No\nORU may be formally established until review as prescribed by the President\nhas been completed. Once established, an ORU will be reviewed periodically at\nintervals of five years or less, in conformance with Board of Regents' Bylaws\nand Policies. The Board of Regents' policy on the establishment and review of\nORUs is supplemented by the Executive Policy promulgated in the ensuing\nparagraphs.  \nA. PURPOSE  \n  \n1\\. ORUs are established to advance the University's research and training\nmission. They foster and support interdisciplinary faculty research\nactivities, and they assist undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate  \nstudents by giving them access to research opportunities, facilities, and\nequipment. ORUs benefit the State of Hawai\u2018i directly through programs of\napplied research, extension service, and training in areas which meet\ncommunity and regional human and economic needs. ORUs provide an efficient,\nvisible, and effective means of pooling appropriate expertise, equipment, and\nmanagement resources.  \n  \nB. ADMINISTRATION  \n  \n1\\. The chief executive officer of an ORU must be a tenured member of the\nfaculty, unless some other arrangement is specifically authorized by the\nPresident. ORU Directors who hold Executive/Managerial positions are analogous\nto Deans of academic schools and colleges, and they are excluded from an\nappropriate bargaining unit. The terms of their service, including appointment\nby the Board of Regents upon recommendation by the President, are specified in\nthe Board of Regents Bylaws and Policies on Executive/Managerial Personnel\n[Appendix 9-14]. ORU Directors who hold faculty appointments are analogous to\nChairs of academic departments in that they may be included in an appropriate\nbargaining unit. Faculty Directors are appointed by the Vice President for\nResearch and Graduate Education. Faculty Directors serve at the pleasure of\nthe University and, like Excluded Directors with return rights, they are\nappointed for one year at a time.  \n  \nC. SCOPE  \n  \n1\\. Most ORUs are interdisciplinary in scope, involving faculty, staff, and\nstudents from two or more areas of instruction and research. There are some,\nhowever, which focus on a single field of study and exist as separate entities\nin part because they are larger and administratively more complex than the\nassociated academic department(s) or program(s). ORUs are normally established\nand maintained only in areas where the University has intrinsic research\nadvantages or particular capabilities to respond to special needs. Such\nadvantages and capabilities are considered long-term. No ORU will be\nestablished or maintained if its goals are short-term, if its objectives are\nessentially the same as those of an existing department or other unit within\nthe relevant campus, or if its objectives can be accomplished just as\neffectively within an existing University administrative structure.  \n  \nD. FUNDING  \n  \n1\\. Core support for an ORU is provided by State general funds through the\nOrganized Research Budget (UOH-102). Additional support is provided by\nextramural funds associated with specific research and training projects\nundertaken by the ORU. In most cases, funding is obtained from both State and\nFederal sources, the ratio of external to core funding is greater than one,\nand more than one external funding source is involved. Private funding can\nalso be important in certain instances. Solicitation and administration of\nexternal grants and contracts, i.e., funds other than outright gifts and apart\nfrom appropriations by the Legislature of the State of Hawai\u2018i, for the\nestablishment and/or maintenance of ORUs, as well as for more informal\narrangements such as consortia, offices, programs, bureaus, laboratories, and\nthe like, must be processed through the University's Office of Research\nAdministration and require the approval of the University's Director of\nResearch.  \n  \nE. FACULTY  \n  \n1\\. State funding enables ORUs to be assigned permanent faculty positions.\nInstructional (I), Research (R), Specialist (S), and Agent (A) faculty may be\nemployed by or affiliated with ORUs, and an ORU can serve as a locus of\ntenure. Fractional appointments and split appointments for faculty from other\nacademic units are permitted in ORUs to foster interdisciplinary research and\nto encourage flexibility in responding to opportunities offered by external\nsponsors of research and training. Such appointments may be supported by a mix\nof State, Federal, and private funds, and faculty may be attached to more than\none unit or department.  \n  \nF. EXCEPTIONS  \n  \n1\\. For historical and other reasons, certain ORUs are exempt from some\naspects of the policies and procedures that apply to organized research units\ngenerally. The nature of the exemption(s) is set forth in separate documents\nfor each unit.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThere is no policy specific delegation of authority.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nThis Executive Policy directs implementation of Regents Policy (RP) 9.213,\nEvaluation of Board of Regents Appointees. This policy provides for the\nsystematic evaluation of the performance of the faculty and other professional\nstaff of the University of Hawai\u2018i (\u201cUniversity\u201d) and calls upon the\nappropriate administrative offices of the University to define the specific\nprocedures for implementation.  \n  \nThe objective of this Executive Policy is to provide procedures to be used in\nreviewing faculty for programs that do not have evaluation procedures in\naccordance with this policy.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nEP 5.221 establishes which faculty positions are eligible for tenure.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n  1. Faculty evaluation procedures (may also be referred to as periodic review) shall be developed and maintained by the University Chancellors/Provost for their respective campuses and by the Vice President for Community Colleges on behalf of the community colleges system, in consultation with appropriate faculty governance organizations and the exclusive collective bargaining representative.\n  \n  \n\n  2. Procedures for review of Administrative, Professional and Technical (APT) employees will be maintained for system wide application by the Vice President for Administration in consultation with the exclusive collective bargaining representative.\n  \n  \n\n  3. For those campuses/programs which do not have their own faculty evaluation procedure, faculty will be evaluated using the procedures indicated in paragraph D. \n  \n  \n\n  4. Procedures for Tenured Faculty Periodic Review  \n  \n\n    1. The Chancellor/Provost, Vice Chancellor/Vice Provost, Dean, or administrative head of each college or comparable organizational unit shall develop a schedule to evaluate all faculty who have not undergone review for promotion, tenure, contract review, or a similar in-depth review during the preceding five years. Faculty who have received a merit pay increase during this period shall also be exempt from this additional review. Faculty whose time since the last such review exceeds five years will be phased in to the schedule over a five-year period in order of length of time since last evaluation.\n  \n\n    2. Each faculty member scheduled for review shall submit to the Department/Division Chair (DC), or comparable program head:  \n\n      1. Evidence of teaching performance including peer evaluations, teaching awards, and/or all available student evaluations of courses taught and/or workshops taught or similar assessments of student learning during the preceding five years, and/or\n  \n\n      2. Citations to scholarly research or other contributions to professional literature published during the preceding five years, and/or\n  \n\n      3. A list of other major accomplishments and/or honors received related to the faculty member\u2019s professional responsibilities during the preceding five years.\n  \n\n    3. The DC will compile a list of all courses taught during the preceding five years and the number of students enrolled in each course.\n  \n\n    4. Prior to making their assessment, the DC will poll the members of the Department/Division Personnel Committee (DPC) to determine whether or not the DPC wishes to participate in the review process.\n  \n\n    5. If the DPC elects to participate in the review process, the DC shall transmit the materials to the DPC, which shall make a written assessment of the faculty member\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. The DPC will transmit this assessment, along with its recommendations, to the DC.\n  \n\n    6. The DC shall make their independent assessment and recommendations.\n  \n\n    7. Either the DC or the DPC may solicit additional information, such as copies of published work, and conduct further study, such as classroom visitation, as may be appropriate.\n  \n\n    8. If there are specific weaknesses identified in the evaluation, the DPC and DC recommendations should address means of improving performance. The DC shall discuss these recommendations with the faculty member before transmitting them to the Dean or Vice Chancellor/Vice Provost.\n  \n\n    9. As appropriate, the DC and DPC shall include recommendations for recognition and reward of superior performance.\n  \n\n    10. The Dean or Vice Chancellor/Vice Provost shall consider the DPC and DC recommendations and, subsequent to an independent evaluation of the record, shall direct that appropriate measures be taken.\n  \n\n    11. After completion of the evaluation process, the Dean or Vice Chancellor/Vice Provost will notify the faculty member of its outcome and establish the date for the next evaluation, which shall be scheduled no later than five years hence and may be scheduled sooner if necessary.\n  \n\n    12. If the faculty member believes that any action taken pursuant to this policy is unwarranted or inappropriate, they may appeal to the Chancellor/Provost or an official designated by the Chancellor/Provost to review the appeal, whose decision shall be final. Any allegation that such an action violates or denies a right granted under the Unit 7 collective bargaining agreement shall be subject to challenge in accordance with the grievance procedures contained in said agreement.\n  \n  \n\n  5. Process for identifying and addressing substandard performance when it emerges  \n  \nWhile the procedure above describes the normal periodic review process, off-\ncycle periodic reviews may be called when the Department Chair and/or Dean\nidentifies performance concerns that must be addressed. It is recommended that\na review commence upon identifying concerns over a faculty\u2019s substandard\nperformance. This review is an opportunity to engage with the individual whose\nperformance has raised concerns so that they may be guided towards achieving\nsatisfactory performance standards. A review for substandard performance may\ninclude the following:  \n  \n\n    1. Faculty will be assessed against their campus, college, and department criteria as applicable, in accordance with the campus\u2019 existing policy on periodic reviews or the periodic review process described above.\n  \n\n    2. As the person responsible for the initial phases of periodic review, Department Chairs will notify their Dean/Director/Supervisor of substandard performing faculty in their unit. If there is no Department or Division Chair, then the person responsible for periodic review may initiate the initial phases of an off-cycle review.   \n\n      1. The Chair should intervene at the informal, non-managerial/academic guidance stage, by communicating to a faculty member that they are not meeting their performance requirements and expectations. Guidance can include providing resources, mentoring, training, and tools and other feedback on how to get their performance back on track.\n  \n\n      2. If the Chair believes that informal guidance is not working, the Chair should discuss their concerns with the Dean or appropriate administrative authority. Addressing substandard performing faculty is an essential duty and responsibility of the Dean or appropriate administrative authority.\n  \n\n    3. The Dean or appropriate administrative authority will discuss with the Chair if a faculty member is identified as failing to meet performance expectations and requires a Professional Development Plan (PDP).  \n\n      1. Each Dean or appropriate administrative authority is responsible for addressing faculty substandard performance at the time it is raised and will need to work with the Chair to ensure that this concern is appropriately handled.\n  \n\n      2. The areas in which a faculty member is not meeting expectations should immediately be communicated to them.\n  \n\n      3. The faculty member, in turn, may respond to the determination of substandard performance and explain their perspective during the initial inquiry and prior to the creation of a PDP.\n  \n\n      4. If there are disagreements about areas of substandard performance, each campus should follow their respective process for resolving such disagreements or follow the above procedure.\n  \n\n      5. If areas of substandard performance are confirmed, a PDP will be created by the Chair in consultation with the faculty member.\n  \n\n      6. A PDP will articulate the goals of the PDP, specific actions that will be taken to address substandard performance, and objective measurable outcomes that will determine a successful outcome. The Dean or appropriate administrative authority shall approve the PDP.\n  \n\n      7. Once a PDP has been established (see appendix for template), there will be an annual review and update on progress made towards the goals of the plan. When the articulated goals have been met, the PDP is completed.\n  \n\n    4. If a PDP is determined to be unsuccessful and the faculty member continues to fail to meet performance requirements, the University may explore other available options, including:   \n\n      1. The Dean or appropriate administrative authority may extend a PDP, establishing new milestones and deadlines to work towards improvement. Included in any extension may be opportunities to reassign faculty to administrative positions or special projects, or engage in additional faculty development.\n  \n\n      2. The Dean or appropriate administrative authority may also recommend to their respective Provost or Chancellor separation from the University for failure to meet performance requirements and expectations. If a faculty member disagrees with the separation, the faculty member can appeal to a performance judge to challenge the conclusion of separation from the University, as articulated in Article XXIV, Grievance Procedure, Section C. Procedures, 2.d., Step 3A. Procedures for non-tenure track faculty job security will be developed with the exclusive bargaining representative.\n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nDelegate to the University Chancellors/Provost and the Vice President for\nCommunity Colleges, on behalf of the community college system, responsibility\nfor development of faculty evaluation procedures in consultation with the\nfaculty governance organization and the exclusive collective bargaining\nrepresentative pursuant to R-20. The Vice President for Community Colleges\nwill also consult with the community college chancellors when developing the\ncommunity colleges\u2019 faculty evaluation procedures.  \n  \nDelegate to the Vice President for Administration responsibility for\ndevelopment of system-wide procedures to be used in evaluating Administrative,\nProfessional, and Technical (APT) employees.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\n  1. To support the goal of the University of Hawai\u02bbi to provide a safe and welcoming place to learn and work.\n  \n\n  2. To support the University\u2019s commitment to equal access for persons with disabilities under federal and state laws and those individuals who may benefit from the presence of a Service or Emotional Support Animal, including students, employees and visitors.\n  \n\n  3. To establish guidelines for the University to support the use of Service and Emotional Support Animals on campus.\n\n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n  1. **Service Animal** : Service Animals are working animals, not pets. A Service Animal is a dog1 that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Service Animals can be trained to perform important tasks to assist individuals with disabilities, including but not limited to providing stability for a person who has difficulty walking, picking up items for a person who uses a wheelchair, performing medical alerts of various types such as high or low blood sugar, or the onset of seizures, guiding people who are blind, or alerting a person who has hearing loss when someone is approaching from behind. Service Animals can also support persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by helping to prevent or interrupt impulsive or self-destructive behaviors. A Service Animal does not include animals that are not trained to perform specific tasks related to the individual\u2019s disability. Service Animals in training are not considered Service Animals under this policy.\n  \n\n  2. **Emotional Support Animal** : An Emotional Support Animal (ESA) is any animal that provides necessary emotional support to an individual with a mental or psychiatric disability that alleviates one or more identified symptoms or effects of an individual with a disability. ESAs are sometimes referenced as therapy animals or comfort animals. An ESA is not a Service Animal.\n  \n\n  3. **Reliable Third Party** : A Reliable Third Party is someone who is familiar with the individual\u2019s disability and the necessity for the requested accommodation. A Reliable Third Party includes a qualified professional who provides medical care, therapy or counseling to persons with disabilities, including, but not limited to, doctors, physician assistants, psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers.\n  \n\n  4. **Research, Teaching and Training Animal** : An animal that is officially part of the University\u2019s teaching, research, training and/or clinical programs. All vertebrate animals used for these purposes must have a valid animal protocol approved by the University of Hawai\u02bbi Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), unless exempted by the IACUC. This policy does not specifically address these animals.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n  1. _Service Animals_\n  \nThe University of Hawai\u02bbi is committed to equal access for persons with\ndisabilities, including students, employees, and visitors, in compliance with\nfederal and state laws. Under federal and state law, Service Animals are\nallowed in areas where animals, including pets, are generally not permitted.\nIndividuals with disabilities may be accompanied by Service Animals on all\nUniversity of Hawai\u02bbi campuses and its premises where members of the public\nare allowed to go. A Service Animal\u2019s work or task must be directly related to\nits owner\u2019s disability.  \n  \n_Members of the Public_  \nUnder federal and state laws, individuals with disabilities are not required\nto provide documentation of their disability, nor are they required to provide\ndocumentation that an animal has been trained as a Service Animal. The law\ndoes not require that the animal wear any type of identifying vest or badge\nindicating that it is a Service Animal and it does not prohibit any particular\nbreed of dog from being a Service Animal.  \n  \nWhen it is not readily apparent that an animal is a Service Animal, the\nUniversity is only permitted to ask the following two questions:  \n  \n\n    1. Is the animal required because of a disability?\n  \n\n    2. What work or task has the animal been trained to perform?\n  \n_Students_  \nStudents may be accompanied by Service Animals in all locations where students\nare allowed, except where the presence of a Service Animal would fundamentally\nalter the nature of a program or an activity and/or pose a direct threat to\nthe health and safety of others. Access to restricted areas as specified in\nSection D. Exclusions may be granted on a case-by-case basis by contacting the\nindividual campus\u2019s Disability Services Office for students2.  \n  \n_Housing and Employment_  \nWhen an individual\u2019s disability or the need for a Service Animal is not\nreadily apparent, an individual with a disability, who is pursuing disability-\nrelated housing accommodations or an employment accommodation, may be required\nto provide information to verify the disability. Documentation may be required\nin order to evaluate whether the requested accommodation may be necessary to\nprovide an equal opportunity to use and enjoy University housing or to perform\nan employee\u2019s essential job functions.  \n  \nStudents seeking disability-related housing accommodations must contact their\ncampus Disability Services Office. Employees seeking disability-related\nhousing accommodations regarding university housing must contact University\nHousing. University employees seeking to be accompanied by a Service Animal in\ntheir work environment must contact their Supervisor, Human Resources, and/or\nADA Coordinator3 to submit a disability accommodation request. The University\nwill process the employee\u2019s request in the same manner as other requests for\nreasonable accommodations. Students should contact their campus Disability\nServices Office with any questions regarding reasonable accommodations.  \n  \n_Misrepresentation of a Service Animal_  \nHawai\u02bbi law and the University prohibit knowingly misrepresenting an animal as\na Service Animal4. The law establishes a civil penalty for misrepresentation\nand discourages persons, including persons with a disability, from\nfraudulently misrepresenting their animals as Service Animals to request\naccess when animals or pets are otherwise prohibited. Persons committing this\nviolation may be subject to a civil fine of not less than $100 and not more\nthan $250 for the first violation, and not less than $500 for a second\nviolation and each violation thereafter. Employees and students of the\nUniversity are subject to discipline for misrepresentation of a Service\nAnimal.  \n  \n\n  2. _Emotional Support Animals (ESAs)_\n  \nESAs may not enter University premises without an official accommodation\ngranted in advance. Students and employees with disabilities who are seeking\npermission to have an ESA in their on-campus residence or in their work\nenvironment must request an accommodation that will enable them to do so.\nStudents should register with their respective University of Hawai\u02bbi campus\nDisability Services Office and follow the accommodation process for that\ncampus. The campus shall properly document the individual\u2019s disability and the\ndirectly related need for the ESA.  \n  \nWhen considering accommodation requests for ESAs, University staff will only\nrequire information necessary to verify whether the individual has a\ndisability and to evaluate whether the requested accommodation may be\nnecessary to provide an equal opportunity to use and enjoy University housing\nor to perform an employee\u2019s essential job functions. When an individual\u2019s\ndisability or the need for an ESA is not readily apparent, documentation may\nbe required from a Reliable Third Party to verify that the request is\nnecessary to provide the individual an equal opportunity to use and enjoy\nUniversity housing or to enable an employee to perform essential job\nfunctions.  \n  \n_Housing_  \nESAs approved for on-campus housing accommodations may accompany the student\nwith a disability within the student\u2019s University housing facility in areas\nwhere the student is allowed to go. Approved ESAs are not permitted in other\nfacilities on campus such as academic spaces or dining facilities.  \n  \n_Employment_  \nESAs approved for employment accommodations may accompany an employee in their\nnormal work environment but are generally not allowed in other areas such as\ndining facilities, or in safety sensitive areas.  \n  \n\n  3. _Responsibilities of Individuals with Service and Emotional Support Animals_\n  \nThe University is not responsible for the care or supervision of any animal\nincluding Service Animals or ESAs. Owners or handlers are responsible at all\ntimes for the proper control and care of their animals and/or for any damage\nor injury they may cause. Owners or handlers must comply with all applicable\nlaws and regulations, including vaccination, licensure, animal health and\nleash laws. All animals shall be restrained with a harness, leash, or other\ntether, unless an individual\u2019s disability precludes the use of a restraint or\nif the restraint would interfere with a Service Animal\u2019s safe, effective\nperformance of work or tasks. All animals must be under the individual\u2019s\ncontrol, whether by voice control, signals, or other effective means.  \n  \nIndividuals are responsible for ensuring the immediate clean-up and proper\ndisposal of all animal waste, e.g., in an outdoor trash can. Although the\nUniversity does not charge an individual with a disability a Service Animal or\nESA surcharge, all costs or other liabilities associated with any damage or\nharm caused by any animal is the owner or handler\u2019s responsibility.  \n  \n\n  4. _Exclusions_\n  \nThe University may exclude a Service Animal or ESA in certain locations due to\nhealth or safety restrictions, where Service Animals or ESAs may be in danger,\nand/or where their use may fundamentally alter the nature of a program or\nactivity. Such restricted areas may include, but are not limited to, sterile\nareas, food service preparation areas, moving machinery, areas with chemicals\nor corrosive materials, and areas with extremely hot/cold surfaces or sharp\nobjects.  \n  \nThe University may exclude a Service Animal or ESA from campus if a particular\nanimal behaves in a way that poses a direct threat to the health or safety of\nothers, or has a history of such behavior. Furthermore, the University may ask\nan individual with a disability to remove a Service Animal or ESA from a\ncampus or other University facilities if the animal is out of control and the\nindividual does not take effective action to control it; or if the animal is\nnot housebroken. In cases where the animal appears to be mistreated, the\nUniversity may ask the handler to remove the Service Animal or ESA from\ncampus, and may also contact law enforcement or other appropriate service\nproviders. The University may require an unclean or unkempt Service Animal or\nESA to be removed until the issue is resolved. In instances where the\nUniversity excludes or removes a Service Animal or ESA from campus, the\nindividual with a disability is allowed to participate in the service,\nprogram, or activity without the Service Animal or ESA.  \n  \nAccess to restricted areas may be granted on a case-by-case basis by\ncontacting the campus Disability Services Office for students or Human\nResources and/or ADA Coordinators for employees who are participating in the\naccommodation process.  \n  \n\n  5. _Animals in Buildings, Facilities and/or Premises_\n  \nAnimals, other than Service Animals and ESAs approved by the University\ncampus, are not allowed in any University buildings, facilities and/or\npremises. Individual campuses in the University of Hawai\u02bbi System may have\nvaried policies or guidelines allowing animals (that are not service animals\nand emotional support animals) to travel on their respective campus premises.\nIndividuals with animals must follow the respective campus policy pertaining\nto animals on campus. In the event that a campus does not have a policy\nrelating to animals on campus, then this section controls.  \n  \n\n  6. _Conflicting Disabilities_\n  \nStudents or employees with a health condition or disability that conflicts\nwith or is adversely affected by exposure to a Service Animal or ESA should\ncontact the campus Disability Services Office for students or for employees,\ntheir supervisor and/or Human Resources. The student or employee may be asked\nto provide documentation that identifies the impacts of their health condition\nto allow the campus to determine if there is a need for a reasonable\naccommodation.  \n  \n\n  7. _University-Sponsored Events_\n  \nOn a case-by-case basis, for time-limited University sponsored events, the\ncampus may allow animals on its premises for the therapeutic benefit of its\nattendees. These type of events must be approved by the Chief Executive\nOfficer of each campus.  \n  \n\n  8. _Disputes/Complaints_\n  \nThe University has internal complaint procedures for addressing complaints\nabout the reasonable accommodation process on its campuses. For issues related\nto Service Animal or ESA accommodations, students may contact their campus\nDisability Services Office and employees may contact Human Resources and/or\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity office.\n\n  \n  \n  \n_____  \n1 Miniature horses may also be included as Service Animals, where reasonable.\nSee 28 CFR \u00a7 35.136(i).\u21b5  \n  \n2 _See_ Section V. for contact information for ADA coordinators.\u21b5  \n  \n3 _See_ Section V. for contact information for ADA coordinators.\u21b5  \n  \n4 Hawai\u02bbi Revised Statutes \u00a7347-2.6.\u21b5  \n\n##  IV.

The University recognizes the rich foundation of\nindigenous Hawaiian cultural values and knowledge, and seeks to learn from\nthis foundation to develop a uniquely strong response to climate change and\nsustainability challenges.  \n  \nHawai\u2018i is highly dependent on imported fossil fuel and endures among the\nhighest electricity rates in the United States. This jeopardizes the economy\nand the health of the physical environment. Recognizing this problem, Hawai\u2018i\nis also one of few states that has adopted a climate change law (Act 234,\n2007), has one of the most aggressive renewable energy policies in the country\n(Hawai\u2018i Clean Energy Initiative 2008) and has established ambitious state\nsustainability goals endorsed by the legislature in the Aloha + Challenge\n(Hawai\u2018i Green Growth Hawai\u2018i) and the Hawai\u2018i State Sustainability Plan. The\nBoard of Regents has embraced sustainability as a core aspect of the UH\nmission, and it is imperative that the UH System, one of the largest consumers\nof energy in the State, establishes an ambitious sustainability policy to\nensure it continues to deliver world class educational and research\nopportunities for generations to come.  \n  \nEvery campus has the opportunity and obligation to embrace sustainability\nprinciples for all campus activities and to set data-based performance\nmeasures to improve resource use efficiencies, increase the generation and use\nof renewable energy, and conserve state social, cultural, economic and\nenvironmental resources. Furthermore, the University is in a position to\nincrease and transmit knowledge in all areas of sustainability, and this\npolicy encourages faculty to research and study problems that directly affect\ncampus and community sustainability, and to include hands-on problemsolving\namong other sustainability education initiatives in the curriculum.  \n\n##  I. Purpose\n\nA.

Responsibilities  \n  \nIt shall be the responsibility of the President to promulgate a policy in\nconsultation with University executives setting forth the guidelines for\nfaculty exchanges.  \n  \nB. Guidelines  \n  \n1\\. The Board supports exchanges of University of Hawai\u2018i faculty with other\ninstitutions as a means of furthering the academic and intellectual growth and\nvitality of our faculty and University.  \n  \na. The President shall be authorized to enter into agreements for faculty\nexchanges in accordance with the following resolution:  \n  \nWhereas, individual faculty exchanges of University of Hawai\u2018i faculty with\nfaculty of other institutions is a means of furthering the academic and\nintellectual growth and vitality of our faculty and University, and  \n  \nWhereas, the State Government has joined the Board of Regents in finding merit\nin faculty exchanges by providing for such arrangements as early as 1941, and  \n  \nWhereas, the Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes, 1968, Section 304-12 reaffirms the\nauthority of the Board to contract for faculty exchanges and sets forth the\ngeneral conditions for the arrangements, and  \n  \nWhereas, the Board may delegate to the President, as its chief executive\nofficer, the authority to enter into contracts,  \n  \nTherefore, be it resolved that it is the policy of the Board of Regents to\ndelegate to the President the authority to enter into faculty exchange\nagreements consistent with the statutes and with other appropriate\nadministrative guidelines the President may wish to issue in order to\nimplement this delegation; and  \n  \nBe it further resolved that the President may further delegate this authority\nto the Chancellors, that each faculty exchange, individual or institutional,\nentered into be reported for information on the Regents' agenda following the\nagreements approval by both parties, and that this policy shall be in effect\nupon full Board approval.  \n  \nC. Guidelines for individual faculty exchanges shall be as follows:  \n  \n1\\. No monetary consideration or exchange will be involved between the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i and the institution from which the visiting faculty\nmember comes or between the University of Hawai\u2018i and the visiting faculty\nmember.  \n  \n2\\. The University of Hawai\u2018i faculty member is responsible for developing an\nagreement with the host institution and for coordinating the details of\nassignment of the visiting faculty member with the appropriate entity in the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i.  \n  \n3\\. The University of Hawai\u2018i will pay to its faculty member the normal and\nfull salary for the period he/she is visiting the host institution in return\nfor the previously stipulated services of the visiting faculty member to the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i.  \n  \n4\\. All privileges and benefits of faculty status, such as credit toward\nsabbatical and collective bargaining salary increases shall accrue to the\nfaculty member involved.  \n  \n5\\. A formal agreement between the Campus Unit and the institution involved is\nto be prepared setting forth the above and any other provisions necessary to\ncarry out an effective exchange. The Chancellor of the University of Hawai\u2018i\nUnit in which the faculty member is located is authorized to approve the\nagreement.  \n  \n6\\. An item specifying the assignment of the University of Hawai\u2018i faculty\nmember and the receiving of a visiting faculty member from the other\ninstitution involved will be placed on the next Regents' agenda following the\napproval of the exchange agreement by the appropriate Chancellor.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo implement Regents Policy RP 1.210 on Faculty Involvement in Academic\nDecision-Making and Academic Policy Development.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. General Procedures  \n  \n1\\. In order to implement the Regents Policy in the spirit with which it was\nadopted, each Chancellor shall seek the advice of the campus faculty\norganizations (CFO) early in the development of general academic policy and\nprior to recommending a new or revised academic policy to the President of the\nUniversity. Within an allowable and mutually agreed upon time frame, advice\nshould also be obtained prior to the issuance of a new interpretation of a\ncurrent major academic policy  \n  \n2\\. In order that the President of the University and the Board of Regents may\nbe aware of academic policies and actions proposed by one or more CFOs for\nUniversity-wide consideration and application, each Chancellor shall\ncommunicate such proposals, accompanied by his independent recommendation, to\nthe President of the University if action is required by the President or the\nBoard of Regents. (If action on the policy proposed is appropriate at the\ncampus or Unit level, transmission to other levels is optional as\ninformation.) The President of the University, in turn, shall solicit advice\nfrom other CFOs and communicate to the Board of Regents the recommendations of\nthe CFOs along with his recommendation if action by the Board is required.  \n  \n3\\. Proposals on academic policies affecting only one campus made by the CFO\nwhich require President or BOR approval shall be transmitted to the President\nby the Chancellor together with his independent recommendation. (If action on\nthe policy proposed is appropriate at the campus or Unit level, transmission\nto other levels is optional as information.) The President shall communicate\nto the Board of Regents the recommendation of the CFO along with his own\nrecommendation if action by the Board of Regents is required.  \n  \n4\\. Each Chancellor shall respond to academic policy recommendations by the\nCFO within a reasonable time. The CFO shall respond to the Chancellor\u2019s\nrequests for advice in a similar manner. Should further action other than that\nby the Chancellor be required on policy proposals (by the President of the\nUniversity or by the Board of Regents) the Chancellor shall communicate to the\nCFO his/her recommendation or action going forward. If the campus\nadministration intends to go forward with a campus academic policy\nrecommendation that differs substantially from the CFO advice, the appropriate\nadministrator shall convey to the faculty such intention and the rationale and\nattempt reconciliation before forwarding the recommendation.  \n  \n5\\. In cases of educational policy proposals that may be initiated by the\nRegents, the President shall decide the manner by which the advice of duly\nconstituted faculty organization is sought and prior to final Board action,\nsuch advice along with Presidential recommendation will be considered.  \n  \n6\\. On academic policy matters in which faculty and administration\nrecommendations forwarded to the President reflect serious differences, the\nPresident or his designee, at the President's discretion, will consider\nassembling representatives from the appropriate CFOs and administration for\nconsultation purposes, prior to making a recommendation to the Board.  \n  \n7\\. Each campus shall have an approved system of faculty involvement as set\nforth in the Regents Policy. Consultations by Chancellors with each other and\nthe Executive Vice-President for Academic Affairs is urged to achieve\nUniversity-wide similarity as to substance and process.  \n  \n8\\. If at any time the CFO or the means by which CFO input is regularly\nsecured becomes ineffective or if the spirit and letter of the RP 1.210 should\nappear to be inoperative, the CFO or the respective Unit or campus\nadministration shall first attempt to resolve the problem at the campus. If\nresolution is not obtained, either party may request a review and evaluation.\nSuch requests may be made directly to the President with a full disclosure of\nreasons for the request, and copies provided to the other party. A request for\nreview, however, must deal only with ineffectiveness of and/or non-conformance\nwith this policy and shall not be utilized as an appeal for operational and\ntransactional decisions.  \n  \nB. Implementation  \n  \n1\\. Until such time as the appropriate Chancellor has approved a revised\nconstitution or charter for the campus, the previous charters shall remain in\neffect with the following exception:  \nProvisions in current charters that require the transmittal of all faculty\nrecommendations to the Board of Regents are voided and the spirit and\nintention of the Regents Policy will be implemented.  \n  \n2\\. Each charter shall go into effect upon the respective Chancellor's\napproval.  \n  \n3\\. Each Chancellor will file with the President all organizational charters\nas they are approved.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nAuthority to approve charter or constitution of campus faculty organization\ndelegated to campus chancellors. Authority to implement RP 1.210 and EP 1.201\nis delegated to the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nThe Board of Regents Policies, RP 9.206, Faculty and Staff Renewal and\nVitality Plans provides that the University administration \u2013 namely\nchancellors and vice presidents - are to develop and maintain a \u201cFaculty and\nStaff Renewal and Vitality Plan.\u201d The President is responsible for\nimplementing this mandate and is delegated authority to approve plans\ndeveloped under this directive This document constitutes the President\u2019s\ndirective to the chancellors and vice presidents and appropriate parameters\nfor developing a renewal and vitality plan. It represents a commitment to the\npremise that an essential element in the success of a good college or\nuniversity is the continuing intellectual vitality of its faculty and staff.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Background  \n  \nHistorically, colleges and universities have obtained, maintained and retained\nquality faculty and staff when institutional policies and conditions have\nencouraged, rewarded, and committed the institution to faculty and staff\nrevitalization as a continuing and normal aspect of its mission. Among those\npolicies and practices most commonly present in the most successful\ninstitutions have been the following:  \n  \n1\\. An unwavering commitment within the faculty and staff, the administration,\nand the governing board to academic freedom and a sound concept of academic\ntenure.  \n  \n2\\. An unimpeachable rigorous review and personnel system that emphasizes\nquality performance, that recruits, retains and rewards the most productive\nand self-revitalizing professionals, and counsels and encourages the\ndevelopment or separation and relocation of others.  \n  \n3\\. The commitment of resources that enables faculty and staff to engage in\ncontinuing professional growth, facilitate sustained professional\ncontributions in their field of expertise, broaden professional competencies,\nacquire new ones, and apply appropriate professional self-evaluation and\nassessment.  \n  \n4\\. Policies and a planning process that emphasize academic governance and an\nunfaltering effort to integrate long term academic planning, professional\nconsiderations in the appropriate selection and separation of faculty and\nstaff, and the traditions of academic freedom and tenure.  \n  \nIn responding to the conditions enumerated, these four traditions must be\npreserved and enhanced.  \n  \nB. Objectives of a Faculty and Staff Renewal and Vitality Plan  \n  \nThe accomplishments of the University of Hawai\u2018i through its dedicated and\nhighly professional faculty and staff are evidence enough of vitality and\nself-renewal as a normal state of the institution. The purpose of the Plan for\neach Unit is to address the contextual factors described above and to develop\nan organized and systematic effort to improve the conditions for assuring\ncontinuing faculty and staff renewal and vitality. The goal sought or realized\nis not new, but the commitment is renewed to strengthen and create the\nconditions that assure the recruitment, retention, and revitalization of the\nprofessionals which carry out the primary missions of the University.  \n  \nThe University Administration does not propose to accomplish the goal of\nrenewal by mandating one uniform structure or Plan for the entire University\nwhich consists of several unlike major Units. Rather, each campus or program\nis encouraged to develop a continuing organized effort uniquely suited to the\nmission, needs, and problems of each subunit.  \n  \nThere are common purposes to be served in this effort, however, which include\nthe need to:  \n  \n1\\. Nurture the intellectual vitality of the faculty and staff and foster its\ncontinuing revitalization within the tenure system;  \n  \n2\\. Improve the quality of instructional, research, and service programs;  \n  \n3\\. Increase the flexibility of the faculty resources base to respond to\nchanging societal needs and student demands during periods of scarce\nresources;  \n  \n4\\. Provide for maximum efficiency and effectiveness in the utilization of\nexisting faculty and staff resources.  \n  \nC. Key Principles for the Development and Usage of the Plan  \n  \n1\\. The Plan should focus on all categories of personnel, including:  \n  \na. Faculty  \n  \nb. Executive/Managerial  \n  \nc. Administrative, Professional and Technical  \n  \nd. Civil Service  \n  \n2\\. There should be appropriate and representative faculty and/or staff\ninvolvement in the development of the Plan.  \n  \n3\\. The final proposed Plan of each campus/program should also be made\navailable to the faculty and staff of that Unit.  \n  \n4\\. The Faculty and Staff Renewal and Vitality Plan is to be utilized by each\nChancellor and in turn the President in reviewing recommendations concerning\nEDP/ADPs, programs, budgets, appointments, promotions, tenure, and other\nrelated personnel and program actions.  \n  \n5\\. The Plan of each Unit is to be updated as part of each biennial budget\nprocess and shall serve as a supporting document that accompanies each Unit\u2019s\nproposed budget to the President.  \n  \n6\\. The Plan may provide for phasing in time or resources.  \n  \nD. Format of the Plan  \n  \n1\\. Section I. Purpose of the Unit Faculty and Staff Renewal and Vitality Plan\nin relation to University\u2019s strategic goals and to the unique needs of the\ncampus or program concerned; and a restatement of the concepts of tenure,\nacademic freedom, and performance review, and the mutual obligations of the\ninstitution and the faculty and staff implied in these concepts  \n  \n2\\.

Identification of program areas in which special efforts should be made to\nassist faculty and staff to obtain professional expertise in a different or\nallied field in order to shift the application to areas of higher anticipated\nneed and actual demand.  \n  \nc. A clarification of the goals, purposes, and objectives of sabbatical and\nother professional leaves and the means for strengthening their implementation\nin relationship to:  \n  \n(1) Personnel and program needs (especially in securing timely notice and in\nrecruiting temporary replacements for faculty on leave),  \n  \n(2) Faculty and staff renewal and turnover,  \n  \n(3) And to any policy changes adopted or recommended (Units University, Board,\netc.) to accomplish these changes.  \n  \nd. A deliberate plan for coordinating the career improvement program with\nfaculty and staff review components.  \n  \n3\\. Section III. Comprehensive Faculty and Staff Appointment and Position\nAssignment Plans and Policies  \n  \na. Program Directions and Priorities  \n  \n(1) Estimated student demand by year by program (including program changes)\nand plans and means for assuring a balance of enrollment to program resources\nby each of the various alternatives (new money and positions, reallocation of\ncurrent positions, reduction in enrollment). (Past and present trend analyses\nshould be included to show the relationship of resources to demand.)  \n  \n(2) Priorities. (If sufficient resources are not available to do it all, which\nprograms and needs have the highest and lowest priorities?)  \n  \n(3) Personnel needs by qualifications ranks, specialties, etc., by programs\nover a six-year period, and a planned recruitment and reallocation timetable\nfor meeting those needs, including information regarding the mix of faculty\n(beginning, intermediate, and senior) desirable by Unit and program in respect\nto future program needs, supported by data on tenure and rank and other\ncategories of personnel past and projected for the 6-year period.  \n  \nb.

The identification of policies and means to maintain a specific number of\npositions to be utilized in non-continuing, non-permanent, non-tenurable\nappointments, and means to relocate tenured or tenure-track appointees if\nnecessary.  \n  \nd. The delineation of responsibility for executing this aspect of the plan.  \n  \n4\\. Section IV. Comprehensive system of periodic review of faculty and staff  \n  \na. The identification of a desirable differentiation of reviews for tenured as\nrelated to non-tenured faculty and staff.  \n  \nb. Clear articulation of criteria, frequency, and possible results of review\nof both tenured and non-tenured Faculty and staff including plans and means\nfor recognizing performance, the purposes and outcomes planned for such\nreview, and by whom the review is to be conducted.  \n  \nc. Inclusion of plans for executive and administrative personnel in line with\nUniversity\u2019s strategic goals.  \n  \n5\\. Section V. Cost Section  \n  \na. Costs of enrollment-related and program change (separate) personnel needs\nfor 6-year period.  \n  \nb. Special costs of any aspect of the Faculty and Staff Renewal and Vitality\nPlan as proposed.  \n  \nc. Other cost factors.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policies regarding speech and other expressive activity on\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i campuses.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Introduction  \n  \nThis Executive Policy establishes the policies and guidelines to implement\nAdministrative Rule, Title 20, Chapter 13, and specifically sections \u00a7 20-13-6\nand \u00a7 20-13-7 regarding speech, assembly, and solicitation, or other\nexpressive activity on University campuses. The free exercise of these\nexpressive activities is guaranteed by the Federal and State Constitution. The\nBoard of Regents has delegated authority to the President to promulgate\npractice and procedure relating to use of university-owned or operated\nfacilities under Board of Regents Policy RP 10.205 (formerly Section 10-5).\nThis Executive Policy supersedes sections of former Executive Policy E10.201\nconcerning the same topic.  \n  \nB. Commitment to Free Expression  \n  \nThe University of Hawai\u2018i is committed to the free and open exchange of ideas\nand affirms the rights of members of the university community to engage in\nspeech and other expressive activity guaranteed by the First Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution and by Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution of the State\nof Hawai\u2018i. These activities may be conducted at such times and places and in\nsuch a manner to assure the orderly conduct and least interference with the\nUniversity responsibilities as a public institution for higher education and\nscholarly inquiry.  \n  \n1\\. Campuses will implement Section 20-13-6 of the Administrative Rules for\nthe University of Hawai\u2018i in a manner to permit non-commercial student speech\nand assembly in all areas generally available to students and the community\nwithout first having to apply for or obtain permission from the Chancellor.\nThese generally available areas include open areas, sidewalks, walkways or\ninternal streets, or other similar common areas.  \n  \n2\\. Persons speaking, assembling, and/or distributing non-commercial material\nshall not physically impede the progress of passersby.  \n  \n3\\. No event, speech, demonstration or other expressive activity on campus\nshall interfere with or disrupt the education process or other scheduled\nactivities of the campus or its facilities. This includes the use of any means\nof amplification that creates noise or diversion that substantially disrupt\nthe orderly conduct of the campus or classes taking place at the time.  \n  \n4\\. The Chancellors of each campus may, but are not required to, designate one\nor more appropriate \u201cforum\u201d areas on their respective campuses where\nindividuals or groups may also assemble and engage in public speech\nactivities. These forum areas shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the\ngenerally available areas identified in subsection 1. Potential users are\nencouraged, but are not required, to give advance notice of their intended use\nof the forum area to the Chancellor or the Chancellor\u2019s designee for the\npurposes of avoiding scheduling conflicts and assuring the equal access to all\npotential users. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as a limit on\nstudent expression.  \n  \n5\\. Individuals utilizing a designated public forum area on campus or using\ngenerally available open areas must comply with University and campus rules\nand policies.  \n  \nC. Solicitation.  \n  \nCampuses will implement the solicitation policy as set forth in Section\n20-13-7 of the Administrative Rules for the University of Hawai\u2018i in a manner\nto permit students to approach others on campus and to distribute non-\ncommercial literature such as petitions, circulars, leaflets, newspapers in\nall areas generally available to students and the community.  \n  \nD. Providing Community Bulletin Boards for Posting of Materials.  \n  \nEach Chancellor shall make available one or several community bulletin boards\nat campus convenient locations for use in posting non-commercial student\nmaterials. To ensure equal access and maximum use of these community bulletin\nboards, all materials displayed on a bulletin board will be dated and removed\nfrom the board after a reasonable period of time determined by the Chancellor.  \n  \nE. Practices and Procedures Covering Time, Place, and Manner of Public Speech\nActivities  \n  \nThe university administration may establish campus specific guidelines\ngoverning time, place, and manner of expressive activities, as long as those\nguidelines do not conflict with the provisions in this executive policy and\nare viewpoint neutral.  \n  \nIn creating these guidelines, Chancellors may recognize that some campus\nbuildings or areas warrant special restrictions.  \n  \nThese time, place, and manner guidelines must not distinguish between\npermissible and impermissible subjects of speech (i.e., these regulations must\nbe \u201ccontent-neutral\u201d). These restrictions must be neutral as to particular\nviewpoint expressed and applied even handedly to all similarly situated\nparties. These guidelines must be narrowly tailored and not substantially\nburden the expressive activity more than reasonably necessary to further the\nCampus interest in the orderly function as an educational and research public\ninstitution. These guidelines must leave open ample alternative channels of\ncommunication.  \n  \nThe Chancellor should encourage speakers to be respectful and recognize and\nthe rights of all students to effectively use campus facilities and property\nto obtain an education.  \n  \nF. Dispute Resolution  \n  \nThe Chancellor shall establish a voluntary dispute resolution process whereby\nmembers of the campus community who believe their free speech rights are\nthreatened may immediately communicate their concerns to designated campus\nadministrators. This dispute resolution process shall engage the parties in\ngood faith discussions for the purpose of devising campus-level resolutions\nacceptable to the campus community.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nA. Campus Chancellors are delegated authority to develop and implement campus-\nspecific guidelines concerning the time, place, and manner for free speech and\nother constitutionally guaranteed expressive activities on their respective\ncampus only to the extent consistent with this Executive Policy.  \n  \nB. Chancellors are encouraged to seek the inputs from campus organizations and\nother members of the campus community, including faculty and administrative\nstaff, in formulating and implementing free speech guidelines. Where a\nChancellor is responsible for multiple campuses, the Chancellor shall\ncoordinate procedure among the campuses and have them applied uniformly.  \n\n##  V.

Trust funds are used to account for designated persons or classes of\npersons who have a vested beneficial interest or equitable ownership or which\nare created or established by a gift, grant, contribution, or bequest that\nlimits the use of the funds to designated objectives or purposes.  \n  \nTrust accounts are defined by the Department of Accounting and General\nServices as a separate holding or clearing account for state agencies. Trust\naccounts also serve as accounting devices to credit or charge agencies or\nprojects for payroll or other costs.  \n  \n6\\. Agency funds are used to account for monies held by a governmental unit in\nan agent capacity of individuals, private organizations and other governmental\nunits or programs.  \n  \n7\\. Bond funds account for the proceeds of general obligation bonds issued by\nthe State and revenue bonds issued by the University that are designated for\nspecific uses.  \n  \nB. Funds groups used by the University  \n  \n1\\.

The Current Unrestricted fund group (FG11) accounts principally focus on\nthe instructional and general operations of the University.  \n  \nb. The Current Restricted fund group (FG12) accounts principally focus on\nresearch or other extramural activities of the University.  \n  \n2\\. The Loan fund group (FG20) is comprised of funds obtained by the\nUniversity from Federal, State, and private sources. These funds are used for\nloans to students. Funds for short-term loans (repayable in one semester) are\ngenerally received from private organizations and individuals.

Academic Affairs  \nExecutive Policy EP 5.211, Grading During COVID-19 Public Health Crisis  \nEffective Date: April 2020  \nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and\nPolicy  \nGoverning Board of Regents Policy: RP 5.201, Instructional Programs  \nReview Date: April 2025  \n\n##  I. Purpose\n\n  1. To address the exceptional circumstances that instructors and students are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic which required an abrupt shift to remote teaching and student support. UH recognizes that the academic, personal, and financial situations of students, faculty, and staff have been abruptly transformed. This policy balances the disruption caused by the sudden need to move all courses online mid-semester with our usual grading standards. \n  \n\n  2. To provide students the option of selecting \u201cCredit/No Credit (CR/NC)\u201d grades for their courses disrupted during the Spring 2020 term. \n\n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n  1. **Credit:** Indicates that the student achieved course learning objectives (or outcomes) at level of \u201cC\u201d or better. The student will be awarded credit. This grade will not be included in the calculation of the student\u2019s GPA. \n  \n\n  2. **No Credit:** Indicates that the student did not achieve course learning objectives at level of \u201cC\u201d or better, _e.g.,_ C-, D, F. The student will not be granted credit for the course. This grade is not calculated in a student\u2019s GPA. \n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n**\n\n  1. Scope of policy\n\n**  \n\n  1. The policy applies only to Spring 2020 courses which have end dates after Spring Break (March 20, 2020). \n  \n\n    1. For part of term courses or 5-week courses **ending prior to Spring break,** grades will be issued as originally assigned. \n  \n\n    2. For part of term courses or 5-week courses **ending after Spring break,** grades will be subject to this policy. \n  \n\n  2. The policy applies to all UH courses, undergraduate and graduate, for the disrupted Spring 2020 term. \n  \n\n  3. For programs whose professional accreditation organizations will not allow for alterations in the grading process during the COVID-19 crisis, a very limited number of exceptions from this policy may be made upon request to the President upon the recommendation of a University of Hawai\u02bbi Officer by April 30, 2020. \n  \n\n  4. Students who request and receive an \u201cIncomplete\u201d grade for a Spring 2020 course will receive the letter grade awarded by the instructor upon completion of the missing work, following the deadline in the Academic Calendar. If the course was previously approved for Credit/No Credit grading before the start of the Spring 2020 semester, the instructor will assign either a CR or NC, as appropriate. \n\n  \n**\n\n* Process\n**  \n\n  1. Faculty will award letter grades as usual for Spring 2020 courses by entering grades into MyUH during the grading period. Courses already established as Credit/No Credit only will continue to use those designations instead of letter grades. \n  \n\n  2. Once the faculty have entered grades, students will be able to view the usual assigned letter grades in STAR-GPS. \n  \n\n  3. At this point, a student may elect to retain the assigned grade or convert the letter grade to the Credit/No Credit option for one or more courses until May 22, 2020 at 4:00 p.m. (until May 14, 2020 at 4:00 p.m. for UH West O\u02bbahu courses). \n  \n\n  4. After 4:00 p.m. on May 22, 2020 (May 14, 2020 for UH West O\u2018ahu), registrars will make the grades final and will include a notation indicating this is a \u201csemester disrupted by COVID-19\u201d on student transcripts. \n\n  \n**\n\n* Implications for Other UH System, Campus and Program Policies, Procedures and Practices\n**  \n\n  1. Within the UH System, students will be \u201cheld harmless\u201d by the choice to select Credit/No Credit in Spring 2020. This policy supersedes all other relevant UH System, campus policies, and requirements described in campus catalogs regarding Credit/No Credit grades or grading for Credit/No Credit grades awarded under this policy. \n  \n\n  2. Examples of policies and requirements which are superseded include but are not limited to: \n  \n\n    1. Academic probation will be extended to the following semester for any student who does not move off academic probation based on their GPA. \n  \n\n    2. An award of a \u201cCredit\u201d grade (C or better grade) will be recognized as meeting requirements at any campus regarding courses, majors, minors, concentrations, certificates, general education courses, electives, \u201cback credit\u201d (UH M\u0101noa only), and/or other admission or graduation requirements. \n  \n\n    3. Courses for which students received a grade of \u201cCredit\u201d will also be recognized as meeting any prerequisites for moving to the next course in a sequence or for transfer within the UH System. \n  \n\n    4. Credit/No Credit grades for Spring 2020 will not be counted toward any existing Credit/No Credit limits in the System. \n  \n\n    5. For the purposes of transfer within the UH System, grades of Credit taken during Spring 2020 will be accepted as meeting the criteria for general education requirements, major requirements, minors, and concentrations at any UH campus. \n  \n\n  3. Students must be able to make an informed decision about the implications of electing the Credit/No Credit option. \n  \n\n    1. Students will be provided information at the time of the announcement of the policy and at the point of selecting the Credit/No Credit option. \n  \n\n    2. Students will be strongly encouraged to meet with an advisor before deciding whether to accept a letter grade or to opt for a Credit/No Credit grade. Circumstances in which students might consider keeping letter grades include, but are not limited to: \n  \n\n      1. Students who earn a C- or D in a course and need to earn credit, _e.g.,_ to meet a general education or elective requirement. \n  \n\n      2. Students who want the grade earned calculated into GPA for any reason, _e.g.,_ eligibility for the Dean\u2019s List, applications for certain scholarships, applications for selective admissions programs, graduate admissions or transfer outside the UH System). \n\n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nThe University recognizes that, at times, graduate assistants may be unable to\nwork due to personal illness or injury, to receive medical care, or due to the\ndeath of an immediate family member. Under the authority of the President,\nthis policy outlines the administration of the graduate assistant sick and\nbereavement leave program.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy-specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n###\n\n  1. Responsibilities  \nThe President is responsible for promulgating a policy in consultation with\nthe University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa Graduate Division, the Graduate Student\nOrganization, the University of Hawai\u2018i Hilo Office of the Vice Chancellor for\nAcademic Affairs and Graduate Council, and the Office of Human Resources\nrelating to graduate student sick and bereavement leave.  \n  \n\n###\n\n  2. General Provisions\n    1. Graduate Assistant supervisors will review and approve leave requests in the Online Leave System (OLS).  \n  \n\n    2. Earning of Sick Leave.   \n\n      1. Graduate assistants shall be advanced sick leave at the beginning of each academic semester (Spring, Summer and Fall). Sick leave advances will be determined by the graduate assistant\u2019s 9-month or 11-month appointment.  \n\n      2. All unused sick leave hours shall be forfeited at the end of the semester and upon the separation of the graduate assistant.   \n\n      3. The System Office of Human Resources shall publish a schedule showing the dates of each semester that sick leave will be advanced and forfeited in the Online Leave System and the number of hours of sick leave that will be advanced. A 9-month graduate assistant shall be advanced no more than 63 hours per year and a 11-month grad assistant shall be advanced no more than 77 hours per year, regardless of total FTE. Sick leave advances for graduate assistants with a 0.25 FTE appointment shall be prorated accordingly.  \n\n      4. Graduate assistants whose start of active employment is after the first day of each semester, including Summer, will have their sick leave advance prorated accordingly for the duration of the semester.  \n\n      5. When a graduate assistant renders less than a full semester of service, the sick leave advance shall be adjusted following the interruption of service and may result in the initiation of the salary and wage overpayment process. Graduate assistants\u2019 sick leave allowance shall be reduced by a prorated amount:  \n\n        1. For the period of any sick leave granted when the employment terminates or is to terminate at the end of such leave;  \n\n        2. For any period of Leave Without Pay;  \n\n        3. For any period of unauthorized leave.\n      6. A graduate assistant\u2019s sick leave allowance shall remain unchanged for any period of paid wage loss replacement under workers' compensation.\n  \n\n    3. Notification of Illness  \n\n      1. Through the OLS, notification of absence because of illness shall be given as soon as possible to the graduate assistant\u2019s supervisor on or before the first day of absence, or if impracticable, as soon thereafter as circumstances permit.  \n\n      2. If the Supervisor does not acknowledge or approve the request, the graduate assistant shall notify the departmental Graduate Chair to appeal or approve the request for sick leave.  \n\n  \n\n    4. Application for Sick Leave  \n\n      1. A request for sick leave shall be submitted via the OLS within five (5) working days after return to duty for supervisor review and approval.  \n\n      2. The graduate assistant shall be required to submit a certificate from a licensed physician for absences of five (5) consecutive working days or more to substantiate the fact that the period of absence was due entirely to sickness and that the graduate assistant is now physically and mentally able to resume the duties of the position. The University may require the graduate assistant to be examined by a physician of the University's choice provided the University assumes the cost of the physician's services.\n  \n\n    5. Sick Leave Charged Only for Regular On-Duty Days  \n\n      1. A regular on-duty day is synonymous with a regular State of Hawai\u2018i work day and does not include holidays and weekends.  \n\n      2. Graduate assistants shall submit a request for sick leave if they are absent from work due to sickness during any regular on-duty days, not to exceed twenty (20) hours per week.   \n\n      3. For graduate assistants on 9-month appointments, regular on-duty days occur during the period beginning with the first day of the semester in the fall and ending with the spring semester's commencement, including periods when classes are not scheduled.  \n\n  \n\n    6. Sick leave may be allowed for medical, dental, optical, and optometric examination appointments that the graduate assistant cannot schedule during non-duty time.  \n  \n\n    7. Bereavement Leave  \n\n      1. Graduate assistants shall be allowed three (3) working days of bereavement leave which shall not be deducted from any other leave to which the graduate assistant receives. Bereavement leave shall be granted on days requested by the graduate assistant, provided they fall within a reasonable period of time after a death in the immediate family.\n      2. If the death or funeral occurs outside the State of Hawai\u2018i, a graduate assistant may request a reasonable number of additional days of leave without pay (LWOP). Additional days of LWOP may affect the graduate assistant\u2019s eligibility for tuition waiver.   \n\n      3. Graduate assistants shall claim all bereavement leave through the OLS.\n  \n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nNo Delegation of Authority found  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nPursuant to Regents\u2019 policy, RP 9.202, the President \u201cshall have the authority\nto establish, amend, and administer a classification and compensation plan for\ngraduate assistants.\" The purpose of this executive policy is to describe the\nduties, qualification and eligibility criteria, compensation, and appointment\nterms for individuals who receive graduate assistantships.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA Graduate Assistantship (GA) is a form of financial assistance provided to\ngraduate students through part-time academic employment. Assistants are paid a\nstipend or a salary and receive tuition remission in exchange for work they\nperform for a faculty member, the department, or the college or school. The\nwork is performed for either a 9-month or 11-month duty period, and the work\nschedule is generally up to 20 hours per week, or .50 full-time equivalence.\nAll GAs are eligible for sick and bereavement leave as outlined in EP 9.240.\nWhere eligible, a GA may receive additional benefits (e.g., additional pay for\napproved work above the 20 hours per week).  \n  \nThere are three types of graduate assistantships: (A) Graduate Assistantships,\n(B) Graduate Teaching Assistantships, and (C) Graduate Research\nAssistantships. Assistantship duties for each type may vary considerably both\nwithin and between programs. However all three types are limited to a workload\nto not exceed 20 hours per week, unless approved for an overload. The three\ngeneral types of graduate assistantships are described below; however, for\npurposes of this policy, the assistantships regardless of type are generally\nreferred to as graduate assistants.  \n  \n\n  1. Graduate Assistant (GA)  \nGraduate assistants (GAs) are graduate students who provide academic and\nprogram support to academic, administrative or service units of the\nuniversity. Their appointment may be either 9 months or 11 months. GA\nresponsibilities may be administrative in nature and consist of duties not\ndirectly related to teaching or research. This may include such duties as\nacademic advising, program/event planning, advising student groups, and\nassisting with the administration of academic and student services offices.  \n\n  \n\n  2. Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA)  \nTeaching assistants (GTAs) usually have a 9-month appointment that corresponds\nwith the academic year. The specific duties of a GTA vary depending on the\nneeds of the department and on the qualifications and experiences of the GTA.\nAll GTAs serve under the supervision of a regularly appointed member of the\nfaculty. They may teach a section(s) of a multi-section course or a laboratory\nsection(s) of a course. In addition, they may assist a faculty member in\ngrading assignments or exams, advising students, laboratory set-up, or\nperforming course-related administrative duties. An experienced GTA may be\nassigned as the instructor of a course. In such a case, the GTA must meet all\nof the qualifications required to appropriately teach the course, or have\ncompleted a relevant training program. All new GTAs are required to attend a\ntraining session offered by the Office of Faculty Development and Academic\nSupport - Center for Teaching Excellence.  \n  \nUniversity policy stipulates that in a course taught by a GTA, the\ndetermination of final grades is the responsibility of the supervising\nfaculty. However, since the GTA plays a significant role in determining grades\nand may be the instructor of record, the supervising faculty and the GTA\nshould thoroughly discuss course grading policies and procedures. The\nsupervising faculty or Department Chair, should have access to all grades for\ncourses taught by a GTA. To ensure fairness to all students enrolled in the\ncourse, grading policies and procedures should be announced at the beginning\nof the semester through a course syllabus. GTAs should be knowledgeable about\nofficial university policies on credits and grades, disciplinary actions, and\nacademic grievance procedures. They should also be aware of the various\nstudent services available at their specific campus as well as the System\nOffice of Student Affairs, so that they may refer students to the appropriate\nresources when necessary.  \n\n  \n\n  3. Graduate Research Assistant (GRA)  \nGraduate Research Assistants (GRAs) usually have an 11-month appointment. In\ngeneral, a GRA supports the research activities of a faculty member who is the\nprincipal investigator of a funded project. The specific duties of a GRA vary\ndepending on the needs of the project and on the qualifications and\nexperiences of the GRA. The duties may be directly or tangentially related to\nthe GRA\u2019s program of study, and results from the research project may be\nincorporated into a thesis or dissertation as relevant. Some GRAs exercise a\ngreat degree of independence while performing their duties; others carry out\nspecific tasks that leave little room for independent judgment. GRAs should be\nknowledgeable about official university policies on research and publication.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nThe President delegates authority to appoint Graduate Assistants to the\nrespective Vice Presidents or Provost/Chancellors, as appropriate, with the\nability to further delegate to Deans/Directors, as applicable, in accordance\nwith the following:  \n  \n\n  1. General duties and responsibilities  \nUnder supervision of a faculty member or other designated supervisor, with\nsome latitude for independent action as appropriate, to serve, for example, in\none or more of the following capacities: teach a section of a multi-section\ncourse or a laboratory section of a course; teach a stand-alone course; assist\na faculty member in grading assignments or exams, advising students,\nperforming course-related administrative duties, preparing exhibits, serving\nas a demonstrations assistant in charge of tutorials, or reviewing material\npresented by the faculty member in charge of the course; supporting and\nassisting in the research activities of a faculty member who is the principal\ninvestigator of a funded project; or assisting in a range of administrative,\nplanning, and organizational activities that may not entirely relate to\nteaching or research.  \n  \nSpecific duties and level of supervision depend on the needs of the project or\ndepartment and on the qualifications and experience of the graduate assistant.  \n\n  \n\n  2. Minimum qualifications and eligibility   \n\n    1. Graduation from an accredited college or university, and acceptance as a graduate student in an advanced degree program.\n  \n\n    2. Only graduate students enrolled in a graduate program for an advanced degree as approved by the University (excluding MD, JD and PharmD) are eligible for assistantships. Applicants must be enrolled in the discipline of the graduate assistantship or possess the minimum requirements of the assistantship assignment. Graduate students enrolled in graduate certificate programs are not eligible.\n  \n\n    3. An applicant must be in good academic standing upon admission (GPA of 3.0 or higher); have an undergraduate scholastic record with an adequate background in the field where the appointment is made; be in continued good academic standing for any renewal of the GA; and may not be on academic probation.\n  \n\n    4. Graduate Assistants must carry a minimum of 6 units of graduate level credit or equivalent toward the degree each semester and must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to be continued in the position. The maximum number of units of graduate level credits should not exceed 9 credits, unless approved by the respective graduate division. Note that one credit of thesis (specifically 700F) or dissertation (800) are equivalent to full time.\n  \n\n    5. International students must also demonstrate proficiency in English through sufficiently high scores in measures determined by each campus. If the language of instruction is Hawaiian, proficiency in the Hawaiian language as determined by the program and relevance to the duties is expected.\n  \n\n    6. Graduate Assistants must possess experience or other qualifications appropriate to the duties of the assistantship to which appointed and meet any further criteria stipulated by individual fields of study. Appointments are made on a competitive basis to the best qualified students.  \n  \nIn addition to grade point average and scores on special examinations, the\nmotivation and goals of the student and familiarity and interest in the\nspecialty areas of the faculty may be important factors in the awarding of\nassistantships.\n\n  \n\n  3. Tuition exemption  \nUH M\u0101noa and UH Hilo graduate assistants, as a function of their appointment\nto an assistantship, are exempt from eligible tuition as it pertains to\napproved coursework for the regular fall/spring semester and, if applicable\nand approved, coursework for Outreach College credits for UH M\u0101noa. Graduate\nassistant appointments of .50 FTE, or 20 hours of work per week, are exempt\nfrom full-time graduate level tuition charges, excluding any student fees.\nGraduate assistant appointments of 0.25 FTE, or 10 hours of work per week, are\nexempt from one-half of the applicable tuition charges, excluding any student\nfees (see RP 6.207(C)).\n\n  \n\n  4. Pay schedule   \n\n    1. A pay schedule shall be developed by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy. The schedule shall reflect steps for appointments, with a 17% differential between 9-month and 11-month based appointments. There shall be 4% differential between steps. The stipend or salary is paid over the duration of the appointment. Attachment A is the current schedule.\n  \n\n    2. The Provost/Chancellor of the University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa and University of Hawai\u2018i at Hilo may determine the minimum step for graduate assistants enrolled in programs at their campus. A campus appointing a graduate student enrolled in another campus must pay the minimum step or higher than the student\u2019s academic home campus. Any UH M\u0101noa unit offering a GA below the minimum must receive prior approval from the Graduate Division. Where the student has external funding (e.g., Fulbright or other fellowships), the GA stipend or salary and the external funding combined can be no lower than the minimum step at which units are allowed to hire a GA.\n  \n\n    3. The pay schedule shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy to consider whether adjustments to the steps need to be made. Considerations will include cost of attendance.\n  \n\n  5. Recruitment and appointment   \n\n    1. The college may determine whether an advertisement is necessary. If the college cannot fill the appointment with eligible candidates, the vacant GA positions should be advertised.\n  \n\n    2. Selections must be made according to the Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. Placement in a teaching, research or other assistant appointment is made as appropriate to the requirements of the assigned duties.\n  \n\n    3. Appointments are generally for one academic year, with the possibility of renewal based on continued progression towards a graduate degree. The appointee must be in good academic standing. Appointments of shorter duration may be warranted if funding cannot be secured for two semesters or if the work required does not exceed two semesters. Appointments of duration of less than one academic year shall be conveyed at the time of selection and contained within the offer letter. In the case of extramurally funded positions, an appointment of more than one year may be offered if funding is available.\n  \n\n    4. Initial placement on the pay schedule will reflect the graduate student\u2019s experience, ability, discipline, and assigned responsibility, but may not be lower than the minimum level designated for the student\u2019s home campus except for students approved to be hired at the lower rate as described in D2.\n  \n\n    5. Notification of appointment to the selectee shall be provided as quickly as possible, followed by an offer letter. See Attachment B for an offer letter template.\n  \n\n  6. Reappointments   \n\n    1. Appointments may be renewed annually, based upon satisfactory performance both as a student and as a graduate assistant, and contingent upon available funds. The designated supervisor (e.g., department chair or principal investigator) is responsible for initiating discussion with the graduate assistant and notifying the respective human resources office.\n  \n\n    2. Advancement to the next step, after at least one year of satisfactory service, may be considered, subject to fund availability, and recommended by the supervisor (e.g., department chair, principal investigator, staff, etc.), with the approval of the pertinent academic dean or institute director. \n  \n\n    3. Reappointments must meet criteria established for new appointees.\n  \n\n    4. Notification of reappointments via a letter of reappointment shall be made to the graduate assistants in a timely manner by April 15 for fall reappointments and November 1 for spring reappointments. If notification of reappointment cannot be given by these deadlines, the graduate assistant cannot be obligated to commit to possible future assistantships.\n  \n\n    5. While individual circumstances may vary, the total time as a graduate assistant should be limited to three years for a master's degree student and to six years for a doctoral or other terminal degree student. \n  \n\n  7. Step advancement. As stated under section F.2., advancement to the next step, after one year of satisfactory service, shall be considered, subject to fund availability. In addition, for doctoral students, upon completion of a graduate master\u2019s degree, the graduate assistant shall submit a copy of the degree documentation and have the opportunity to meet with the supervisor to discuss a justified step movement. All proposed step advancement shall be recommended by the designated supervisor (e.g., department chair, principal investigator, staff, etc.) with the approval of the pertinent academic dean or institute director. The frequency of the step movement is subject to fund availability and individual program guidelines which accounts for internal salary alignment. \n  \n\n  8. Outside employment. The University\u2019s priority for a graduate assistant is degree completion. While outside employment in addition to the graduate assistantship is not prohibited, such outside employment is discouraged to allow the graduate student to focus on degree completion. However, the University recognizes the need for graduate assistants to fulfill personal financial obligations. The graduate student shall consider the impact of such outside employment on degree completion and the fulfillment and performance of the graduate assistant duties and responsibilities, and address any conflicts of interest. Where applicable, graduate assistants may be required to complete an outside employment form as detailed in RP 9.207.\n  \n\n  9. Schedule accommodation and duties coverage. Graduate assistants do not earn vacation leave. EP 9.240, graduate assistants are eligible for sick and bereavement leave. Through the Online Leave System (OLS), notification of absence because of illness shall be given as soon as possible to the graduate assistant\u2019s supervisor on or before the first day of absence, or if impracticable, as soon thereafter as circumstances permit. Sick leave may be allowed for medical, dental, optical, and optometric appointments that the graduate assistant cannot schedule during non-duty time.  \n  \nGraduate assistants shall be allowed three (3) working days of bereavement\nleave which shall not be deducted from any other leave that the graduate\nassistant receives. Bereavement leave shall be granted on days requested by\nthe graduate assistant, provided they fall within a reasonable period of time\nafter a death in the immediate family. If the death or funeral occurs outside\nthe State of Hawai\u2018i, a graduate assistant may request a reasonable number of\nadditional days of leave without pay (LWOP). Additional days of LWOP may\naffect the graduate assistant\u2019s eligibility for a tuition waiver. Graduate\nassistants shall claim all bereavement leave through the OLS.  \n  \nIn situations where a graduate assistant is unable to attend work due to\nillness, emergency or bereavement, the designated supervisor (e.g., department\nchair, principal investigator, staff, etc.) shall identify a primary and a\nsecondary department member who will serve as the point of contact and provide\naccommodations in the graduate assistant work schedule. In the case where\nthere are critical teaching or research deadlines, to the extent it is\npossible under the circumstances, the graduate assistant shall work with the\ndesignated supervisor to identify resources to provide the critical teaching\nor research coverage.\n\n  \n\n  10. Termination of Assistantship. An assistantship may be terminated if the student fails to maintain good academic standing, if performance is unsatisfactory, for misconduct, or for lack of funding. The graduate assistant shall be given reasonable notice.\n  \n\n  11. Resignation. A graduate assistant may terminate the assistantship with reasonable notice.\n  \n\n  12. Grievances. An employment-related grievance shall be filed in accordance with the GA Complaint Procedure.\n  \n\n  13. Other. Graduate assistants who meet the eligibility requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act or Hawai\u2018i State Family Leave, may request leave pursuant to University procedure.\n\n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nThis Executive Policy maintains the policy-based administrative infrastructure\ncreated by former Board policy relating to the designation of high demand\ndisciplines. The purpose of this executive policy is to establish guidelines\nfor the identification of high demand disciplines.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Responsibilities  \n  \nIt shall be the responsibility of the President to promulgate a policy in\nconsultation with University executives setting forth the guidelines relating\nto the identification of high demand disciplines.  \n  \nB. Guidelines  \n  \n1\\. The following guidelines shall be used to identify high demand\ndisciplines, which shall be periodically reviewed:  \n  \na. A program, discipline, sub-specialty or unique skill(s) is determined to be\nnecessary to achieve the goals that have been set for the relevant area.  \n  \nb. It shall be demonstrated that faculty of the quality desired by the\nUniversity in the relevant area cannot be recruited and/or retained below the\napproved salary threshold. Evidence shall be presented to show that greater\nthan normal losses have resulted and are likely to result, and recruitment has\nbeen hampered because of non-competitive salaries.  \n  \nc. Comparative data shall be presented showing salaries being paid by\ncompetitors for University personnel of comparable qualification levels. In\nmost cases, competition from other institutions of higher education is the\nappropriate base of comparison. For some vocational or occupational training\nprograms where recruitment is limited to the local labor market, attention to\ncompetition from this market may be necessary.  \n  \nd. Salary surveys referenced shall use proven methods of data gathering and\nstatistical analysis and be deemed credible and reliable.  \n  \ne. It shall be shown that a salary deficiency is causing the staffing problem\nand not some other influence within the control of the program or the\nUniversity.  \n  \nC. High Demand Disciplines  \n  \n1\\. The following have been identified as high demand disciplines:  \n  \na. University of Hawai\u2018i at Manoa  \n  \n(1) All disciplines in the Shidler College of Business Administration\nincluding School of Travel Industry Management  \n  \n(2) Oceanography  \n  \n(3) Geology and geophysics  \n  \n(4) Astronomy  \n  \n(5) All disciplines in the College of Engineering  \n  \n(6) Marine biology  \n  \n(7) Marine-related disciplines and zoology  \n  \n(8) Computer science  \n  \n(9) Meteorology  \n  \n(10) Health sciences.

Purpose and Authority\n\n  1. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance on the hiring of APT employees, including the establishment and recruitment of positions and the determination of initial salaries. APT employees provide administrative, professional and technical support and services to the University and the community for research, academic, student and administrative purposes. The APT classification is unique to the University, as it groups positions into 4 bands, each of which covers a wide range of duties. The positions are broader in exchange for flexible initial hiring salaries and merit-based salary increases and performance bonuses.\n  \n\n  2. The President has the authority to establish, amend or abolish APT bands and groups.\n\n  \n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nRefer to Definitions.  \n  \n\n##  III. Hiring an APT Employee\n\nSupervisors shall obtain approval to hire an APT employee via the following\nprocess.\n\n###\n\n  1. Justify Need\n    1. For a new position, supervisors should consider the services the unit provides and how the new position supports these services.\n  \n\n    2. For vacant existing positions, supervisors shall evaluate (1) the impact of not filling a vacant position and (2) whether the position may support the unit in other ways. If the vacancy will have a negative impact on the unit\u2019s operations or the position may be redescribed to satisfy an operational need, units should recruit to fill the position. Casual hires, overtime, temporary assignment and other temporary staffing options may be utilized, but should not be relied upon for extended periods of time. Units should actively recruit to fill the vacancy during the interim.\n\n###\n\n  2. Establish/Update APT PositionConsult with HR Representative to develop the Position Description:\n    1. Position Descriptions should be written broadly and flexibly to allow for in-band growth through career development. See EP 9.218.\n    2. Position Descriptions should be updated when there are significant job changes, which may support a change in band. See EP 9.218.\n\n###\n\n  3. Determine Band and Group\n    1. Review band concepts, band guidelines, and career groups to determine appropriate band and job title.\n  \n\n    2. Band C and D positions will undergo additional review. The Office of Human Resources (OHR), and the UH Hilo, UH West O\u2018ahu and Community College System HR Offices will consult with the committee of subject matter experts, as appropriate.\n  \n\n    3. Chancellors (UHH and UHWO), Provost and Vice Presidents shall have the authority to band and designate the Career Group for all APT positions within their organization. Community College Chancellors shall have the authority to band and designate the career group for positions in Bands A and B. See EP 9.112, Delegation of Authority for Personnel Actions.\n  \n\n    4. The effective date shall be the date the request is officially approved by the approving authority in the Position Description Generator. An earlier effective date may be authorized by the approving authority when deemed equitable.\n  \n\n    5. An employee or supervisor may request an administrative review of the band action taken on the position by submitting the administrative review form to the respective approving authority.\n  \n\n    6. In the event the employee or supervisor is not satisfied with the outcome of the administrative review, an appeal may be filed with the APT Classification Appeals Board.\n\n###\n\n  4. Recruit for APT Employee\n    1. Supervisors shall select the most qualified candidate that best fits the needs of the unit and in accordance with the Unit 8 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n  \n\n    2. Units shall utilize the on-line recruitment system as a recruitment tool for all APT job announcements; comply with all EEO/AA requirements (see RP 1.205 and RP 4.201); appropriately develop interview questions; conduct thorough interviews; and complete reference checks prior to making a selection.\n\n###\n\n  5. Establish Initial Salary\n    1. Refer to Salary Placement for non-IT Professional and Salary Placement for IT Professional to determine initial hiring salary for for APT Professional.\n  \n\n    2. The University desires to attract and retain competent APT employees and be competitive with the appropriate market.\n  \n\n    3. As a general rule, the initial salary should be at the minimum step of the assigned band unless a higher salary is justified and approved.\n  \n\n    4. The initial salary and State of Hawai'i benefits package should be competitive with internal and reputable external salary benchmarks.\n  \n\n    5. An initial salary for applicants shall fall between the minimum and maximum step of the assigned band, and shall take into consideration:  \n\n      1. Applicant\u2019s relevant experience, education and training\n  \n\n      2. Applicant\u2019s demonstrated ability to immediately apply required knowledge and skills to the job\n  \n\n      3. Assigned duties and responsibilities of position\n  \n\n      4. Preferred salary requirement\n  \n\n      5. Comparable UH salaries within campus or University, and\n  \n\n      6. Available funding\n  \n\n    6. The Chancellor/Vice President/Provost (or designee) is the approving authority, and the initial salary shall be approved prior to the formal offer being made by the supervisor.\n\n###\n\n  6. Send Offer Letter\n    1. Offer letter templates are available in the on-line recruitment system for campuses/schools/programs to use and/or adapt to fit most employment situations.

Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. Honorary Degrees  \n  \n1\\. The board may confer honorary degrees to individuals in accordance with\nthe criteria and conditions established below:  \n  \na. The candidate must be distinguished with the equivalent of a national or\ninternational reputation. Scholarship, the arts, public service, the\nprofessions, and business and industry are examples of general areas in which\ndistinguished accomplishments may warrant the award of an honorary degree by\nthe university.  \n  \nb. Service of benefaction to the university does not in itself provide\njustification for the award of an honorary degree. The candidate must be\ndistinguished in some appropriate field.  \n  \nc. Honorary degrees shall not be awarded to members of the board or to active\nemployees of the university, nor to former employees of the university until\nat least one year after the date of retirement or separation, except that the\nboard may confer an honorary degree to an employee if the justification for\nthe award is based substantially on extraordinary achievements clearly\nexternal to the individual\u2019s employment at the university.  \n  \nd. Honorary degrees shall not be awarded to individuals holding elective\noffice in and from the State of Hawai\u2018i for a period of at least one year\nafter retirement or separation.  \n  \ne. Academic degrees earned after a prescribed course of study normally are not\nawarded as honorary degrees.  \n  \nf. An honorary degree is awarded by the university as a whole rather than by a\ncampus on which the conferral shall take place; therefore, more than one\nuniversity honorary degree shall not be awarded to any individual.  \n  \ng. Academic ceremonies at which honorary degrees may be conferred are\nuniversity celebrations, commencement ceremonies, inaugurations and special\nconvocations when authorized by the president. Usually, only one honorary\ndegree will be awarded at each ceremony.  \n  \n2\\. The president is authorized to promulgate, in consultation with the board,\nappropriate procedures for the nomination and review of individuals to be\nconsidered for the award of honorary degrees. All honorary degrees shall be\nawarded by the board or by the president at the direction of the board.  \n  \nB. Regents\u2019 Medal of Distinction and Regent\u2019s Medal  \n  \n1\\. The Regents\u2019 Medal of Distinction may be conferred at the discretion of\nthe board on individuals of exceptional accomplishment and distinction who\nhave made significant contributions to the university, state, region, or\nnation, or within their field of endeavor.  \n  \n2\\. The Regents\u2019 Medal may be conferred on other individuals for whom the\nboard desires to show high esteem.  \n  \n3\\. The awarding of the Regent\u2019 Medal of Distinction and the Regents\u2019 Medal\nshall be separate from ceremonies associated with honorary degrees and shall\nbe at a site and time selected by the board and the president.  \n  \nC. University Distinguished Professor  \n  \n1\\. The title \u201cUniversity Distinguished Professor\u201d is conferred as an honorary\ndesignation upon an individual outside the university faculty and staff, whose\naffiliation would enhance the university\u2019s stature and significantly\ncontribute to its development. Conferred for life, this title is reserved for\nthose scholars who have achieved national and international distinction as a\nresult of their exceptional contributions to their academic discipline and\ntheir outstanding scholarly attainment. This title is awarded by the Board of\nRegents upon the recommendation of the president of the university.  \n  \n2\\. The president shall promulgate policies and procedures regarding matters\nsuch as eligibility criteria, and selection, recognition and privileges\nafforded designees.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe president is authorized to promulgate, in consultation with the board,\nappropriate and may so award honorary degrees at the direction of the board.\nSee RP 5.209(A)(2).  \n\n##  V.

Executive Policy\n\nThe University can best achieve its mission by creating a supportive working\nenvironment in which individuals encourage one another to pursue excellence in\ntheir professional and personal lives. Students, faculty and staff share a\nresponsibility to help one another by learning to recognize the signs and\nbehaviors associated with substance abuse and addiction, and by encouraging\nthose with such problems to seek appropriate help and rehabilitation. Once an\nindividual has undergone treatment for substance abuse or addiction, the\nUniversity should extend support and encouragement during the recovery phase.  \n  \nThe University expects lawful behavior by students, faculty and staff during\ntheir presence on University premises and at University events. Within the\nconstraints of its mission, the University encourages cooperation with law\nenforcement agencies in enforcing statutes regarding the use of illegal drugs.  \n  \nSubstance abuse interferes with the physiological and abstract processes\nthrough which mental activity occurs and with social behaviors required for\nresearch and learning. Consequently, the University expects that students,\nfaculty and staff will carry out their responsibilities free of any substance\nabuse.  \n  \nA. University Expectations Regarding Substance and Alcohol Abuse and Illegal\nDrugs  \n  \n1\\. Students, faculty and staff are expected to perform their duties free of\nintoxication by any illegal drugs or alcohol.  \n  \n2\\.

Students, faculty and staff are expected to share responsibility for the\nwell-being of each other, for recognizing the behaviors associated with\nsubstance abuse, and for encouraging those in need to seek assistance or\ntreatment.  \n  \n5\\. The University community should expect support services and supportive\nattitudes by its members for students, faculty and staff reentering the\ncommunity after treatment for or during recovery from substance abuse.  \n  \n6\\. The University expects its students, faculty and staff to share\nresponsibility for preventing substance abuse and addiction and for providing\neducation about the subject through studies, research and special programming.  \n  \n7\\. The University should expect to assume a leadership role in the\nacquisition and transmission of knowledge related to substance abuse and\naddiction, and to collaborate with the broader community in activities related\nto prevention of drug abuse including training of professional workers in this\narea.  \n  \n8\\. The University recognizes that substance abuse is a complex problem that\nis not easily resolved solely by personal effort and may require professional\nassistance and/or treatment. Students, faculty and staff members with\nsubstance abuse problems are encouraged to take advantage of available\ndiagnostic, referral, counseling and prevention services. The University will\nnot excuse misconduct by employees and students whose judgment is impaired due\nto substance abuse.  \n  \nB.

Within thirty days after receiving notice from an employee of a conviction\nunder subparagraph F.2. above, the University shall (a) take appropriate\npersonnel action against such employee, up to and including termination; or\n(b) require such employee to satisfactorily participate in a drug abuse or\nrehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a federal, state, or\nlocal health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.  \n  \nG. General Provisions  \n  \n1\\. Substance abuse or the use of illegal drugs shall not provide an excuse\nfor work related performance that is deemed unsatisfactory.  \n  \n2\\. Consistent with its mission, the University will cooperate with law\nenforcement agencies responsible for enforcing statutes related to the use of\nillegal drugs.  \n  \n3\\. The University actively encourages employees and students who are engaged\nin substance abuse to seek appropriate help and treatment. Employees/students\nwho undergo such treatment will be provided with a positive and supportive\nwork/learning environment.  \n  \n4\\.

Departmental Fiscal Administrators should be aware of the status of\ncapital assets under their purview to ensure that any Impairments are reported\nto the Capital Asset Accounting Office (CAAO) via memorandum as soon as they\noccur. The memorandum should include:  \n  \na. The date the incident occurred.  \n  \nb. The percentage of Impairment and/or dollar amount.  \n  \nc. A description of the incident.  \n  \nd. Location of the incident.  \n  \n2\\. The CAAO is responsible for determining the proper accounting for impaired\ncapital assets based on the information provided.  \n  \nB. Assessment of Impairment  \n  \nThe determination of whether a capital asset has been impaired is a two-step\nprocess: 1) Identifying potential Impairments; 2) Testing for Impairment. The\nevents or circumstances affecting a capital asset that may indicate Impairment\nare prominent \u2013 that is, conspicuous or otherwise known to the University.\nRefer to Attachment 1 for a flowchart presentation of the capital asset\nImpairment decision process.  \n  \n1\\. Identifying Potential Impairments  \n  \na. Evidence of physical damage, such as for a building damaged by fire or\nflood, when the level of damage requires restoration efforts to restore\nservice utility.  \n  \nb. Enactment or approval of laws or regulations or other changes in\nenvironmental factors, such as a new water quality standard that a water\ntreatment plant does not meet and cannot be modified to meet the new\nrequirements.  \n  \nc. Technological change or evidence of obsolescence, such as that related to a\nmajor piece of diagnostic or research equipment (e.g., a magnetic resonance\nimaging machine or scanning electron microscope) that is rarely used because\nnewer equipment provides better service.  \n  \nd. Change in the manner or expected duration of use of a capital asset, such\nas closure of a school prior to the end of its useful life.  \n  \ne. Construction stoppage, such as stoppage of a building due to lack of\nfunding.  \n  \n2\\. Testing for Impairment  \n  \na. Capital assets shall be considered impaired when both of the following\nfactors are present:  \n  \n(1) The magnitude of the decline in service utility is significant in relation\nto the service utility of the asset.  \n  \n(2) The decline in service utility is unexpected. The restoration cost or\nother Impairment circumstance is not part of the normal life cycle of the\ncapital asset.  \n  \nb. If the above Impairment tests are met, the capital asset is considered to\nbe impaired. However, only losses from permanent Impairments of capital assets\nshould be recognized in the financial statements as GASB 42 provides that\nImpairment losses recognized should not be reversed in future years. An\nexample of an Impairment that is likely to be temporary would be the closure\nof a middle school due to declining enrollment. This asset should not be\nwritten down if evidence of enrollment projections substantiated by elementary\nschool enrollment, residential development data, birth rates, or other\neconomic indicators demonstrates that the closure would be temporary.  \n  \nc. When an event or circumstance indicates that a capital asset may be\nimpaired, but the test determines that Impairment has not occurred, the\nestimates used in depreciation calculation (i.e., remaining estimated useful\nlife and salvage value) should be reevaluated and changed if necessary.  \n  \n3\\. Measurement of Impairment  \n  \nLosses on impaired capital assets that the University will continue to use\nshould be determined using the method that reflects the diminished service\nutility of the capital asset. GASB 42 prescribes three different methods.  \n  \na. Restorations cost approach \u2013 This approach uses the estimated cost to\nrestore the capital asset and to identify the portion of the historical cost\nof the capital asset that should be written off. This approach should be used\nfor Impairments resulting from physical damage.  \n  \nb. Service units approach \u2013 This method estimates the total or maximum service\nunits that the asset could have provided both before and after the Impairment\nevent or change in circumstance. The percentage change in units would be\napplied to the carrying value of the capital asset to determine the amount of\nthe Impairment loss. Impairments resulting from enactment or approval of laws\nor regulations, changes in environmental factors or from technological\ndevelopment or obsolescence generally should be measured with this approach.  \n  \nc. Deflated depreciated replacement cost approach \u2013 This approach quantifies\nthe cost of the service currently being provided by the capital asset and\nconverts that cost into historical cost. The difference between the resulting\ndepreciated, deflated replacement cost and the carrying value of the original\nasset represents the Impairment loss. Assets impaired by a change in manner or\nduration of use should be measured using this approach or a service units\napproach. Refer to Attachment 2 for a flowchart presentation of the\nmeasurement of asset.  \n  \n4\\. Capital Project Impairments  \n  \nIn order to expand, improve or maintain the University\u2019s facilities and\ninfrastructure, capital projects (i.e., new construction or expansion,\nrenovation, or replacement projects) are routinely initiated or conducted.\nHowever, there are instances when capital projects in progress are canceled,\nwhich results in capital asset Impairment.  \n  \na. Examples of Capital Project Impairments  \n  \n(1) Project cancelled due to lack of funding.  \n  \n(2) Project cancelled in the design phase or stopped due to special\ncircumstances.  \n  \nb. To report a capital project Impairment, a memorandum needs to be completed\nby the responsible capital project office and submitted to CAAO with a copy to\nthe Campus Chancellor, the Director of Financial Management Office and\nController, and the Vice President for Administration with the following\ninformation:  \n  \n(1) Project number  \n  \n(2) Project scope  \n  \n(3) Board or departmental approval to start the project  \n  \n(4) Project location  \n  \n(5) All contract (e.g., construction contract, architect/engineering services\ncontract, construction management contract) numbers and the vendor name  \n  \n(6) Last payment date  \n  \n(7) Chart code, account number, and funding source  \n  \n(8) Total project amount  \n  \n(9) Impairment amount  \n  \n(10) Reason for discontinuing the project  \n  \n(11) Project Manager signature and date  \n  \n(12) Facilities Fiscal Administrator signature and date  \n  \n(13) Office of Capital Improvements Fiscal Administrator (GO Bonds) signature\nand date  \n  \n(14) Director of Facilities or Office of Capital Improvements signature and\ndate  \n  \n5\\. Reporting Impairment Losses  \n  \nGASB 42 requires the recognition of capital asset Impairments as soon as they\noccur. Losses from permanent Impairments should be recognized in the statement\nof revenues, expenses, and changes in net assets as a program or operating\nexpense, special item, or extraordinary item, in accordance with the guidance\nin paragraphs 41-46, 55, 56, 101, and 102 of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic\nFinancial Statements \u2013 and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \u2013 for State\nand Local Governments. The only Impairment type that would typically qualify\nas a special item (i.e., within the control of management) would be a change\nin manner or duration of use.  \n  \n6\\. Insurance Recoveries  \n  \na. The restoration or replacement of the impaired capital asset should be\nreported as a separate transaction from the Impairment loss and insurance\nrecovery.  \n  \nb. The Impairment loss should be reported net of the associated insurance\nrecovery when the loss and recovery occur in the same fiscal year.  \n  \nc. Insurance recoveries reported in years subsequent to the Impairment loss\nshould be reported as program revenue, non-operating revenue, or extraordinary\nitems, as appropriate.  \n  \n7\\. Appropriations Received in Lieu of Insurance Recoveries  \n  \nState appropriations and Federal grants (i.e., FEMA grants) should not be\nnetted against any associated Impairment loss. Insurance recoveries are netted\nwith associated Impairment losses because the insurance recovery is received\nin accordance with an insurance contract in effect prior to the Impairment\nevent. Federal and State financial assistance is provided after the Impairment\nevent occurs and in some instances only after a government applies for and\nmeets applicable grant requirements. Such awards constitute separate\ntransactions from the Impairment event (GASB\u2019s Comprehensive Implementation\nGuide \u2013 2005, question 7.469).  \n  \nC. Retirement of Real Property  \n  \n1\\. Exchange of Real Property  \n  \na. The Office of Capital Improvements shall notify the CAAO of any exchanges\nof Real Property via memorandum and attach copies of exchange documentation.  \n  \nb. The CAAO shall record the Real Property exchange in the University\u2019s\ncapital asset management module.  \n  \n2\\. Demolition of Real Property  \n  \na. The responsible campus facilities management office shall notify the CAAO\nof any Real Property assets that have been or will be demolished via\nmemorandum and provide any requested documentation.  \n  \nb. The CAAO shall record the retirement of the Real Property asset in the\nUniversity\u2019s capital asset management module.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo establish Systemwide controls for University-owned indicia, and to permit\nmanufacturers and related commercial entities the use of such indicia on or in\nproducts.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. Indicia: As used in this policy, \u201cindicia\u201d includes without limitation, the\nfollowing: the name, seal, logos, symbols, initials, designs, logographics,\nother abbreviations or verbiage developed by or associated with the\nUniversity, or any college, school, department, or activity, within the\nUniversity System, and which may be applied to items manufactured for sale to\nthe public.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. INTRODUCTION  \n  \nUnder Section 304A-103(3), Hawai?i Revised Statutes, 2006, as amended, the\nUniversity of Hawai?i by its Board of Regents has the power to enter into\ncontracts on terms it deems appropriate and to manage its property. The\nPresident has been delegated the authority to approve, sign and execute\ncontracts, as provided by Board of Regents Policy, Section 8-1a. The following\nobjectives, policies and guidelines provide for the systematic control and use\nof the University-owned indicia, to enable the University to benefit from\nrevenues generated through the use of the indicia such as logos, seals,\nsymbols, marks, verbiage and other trademarks identified with the University\nof Hawai?i.  \n  \nThis policy establishes the University\u2019s collegiate licensing program in\naccordance with Section 1-6 of the Board of Regents Policies.  \n  \nB. ADMINISTRATION OF LICENSING POLICY  \n  \n1\\. Licensing Administrator: An individual who: (1) coordinates and oversees\nthe daily operation of the licensing program and (2) develops and implements\nadministrative policies and objectives pertaining to the protection and proper\nuse of the University indicia.  \n  \na. The Licensing Administrator shall have the authority to:  \n  \n(1) propose practices and procedures to implement this policy;  \n  \n(2) register the indicia with the appropriate Federal and/or State agencies;  \n  \n(3) propose royalty rates and/or administrative fees to be charged to\nlicensees;  \n  \n(4) initiate documentation to grant licenses or otherwise authorize third\nparties to use the indicia;  \n  \n(5) work with the University\u2019s contracting officer to contract with agents to\nassist in the administration of this program on a local, national, and\ninternational level; and  \n  \n(6) review the use of the indicia on products, in promotions, and in other\ncommercial uses that may arise from time to time.  \n  \n2\\. Licensing Committee: The Vice President for Administration may appoint a\nLicensing Committee to work with the Licensing Administrator to establish\npractices and procedures to implement this policy. The Vice President for\nAdministration shall appoint a member of the Committee to serve as its chair.\nThe Committee shall function in an advisory capacity to the Vice President for\nAdministration.  \n  \n3\\. Categories, Indicia: Indicia fall into two basic categories as follows:  \n  \na. Those works in which the University owns the copyright, and qualify for the\nrelatively simple registration process under the federal Copyright Law, as\namended (17 U.S.C. 101, et, seq.). These works generally include creative\npictorial and graphic works, e.g. two-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and\napplied art, photographs, prints, maps, diagrams, etc.; and  \n  \nb. Those de minimis works in which creative authorship is slight such as\nnames, titles, slogans, letterings, colorings, etc., which would not qualify\nfor copyright. These Indicia are more properly subject to State of Hawai?i\nTrademark Registration (Chapter 482, H.R.S., as amended) if the use is limited\nto intrastate; and concurrent State registration, as well as federal\nregistration under the Federal Trademark Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C.\n1051-1127) if the use is in both intrastate and interstate commerce.  \n  \n4\\. License/Minimum Standards: Standard non-exclusive licenses shall be\ncontrolled, numbered, and issued to each licensee by the University\u2019s\ncontracting officer or his/her designee. The minimum standards to be met by\neach licensee are as follows:  \n  \na. At the time of license execution, each licensee shall be required to pay\nthe University the advance guaranteed annual royalty and administrative fees\nas specified under this policy;  \n  \nb. Each licensee shall be issued a non-exclusive license for an initial term\nof not longer than one (1) year subject to revocation for cause;  \n  \nc. Each licensee shall pay a reasonable annual royalty that adequately\nreflects the value added to the product on which the indicia are displayed. In\ndeveloping the royalty rate, consideration may be given to the cost to the\nconsumer, the impact on the licensees and retail community, and the rates in\nplace at institutions of similar size and stature to the University;  \n  \nd. Each licensee shall observe established University rules and policies;  \n  \ne. Each licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the University and\nthe State of Hawai?i, and their officers, employees, agents, and\nrepresentatives, and any person acting for or on their behalf, from and\nagainst any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action,\njudgments, injunctions, orders, rulings, directives, penalties, assessments,\nliabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including, without\nlimitation, attorney\u2019s fees and litigation related costs), arising from any\nclaimed injury to or death of persons, personal injury, or damage to or\ndestruction of property, resulting from or related to any act or omission of\nthe licensee, or any of the licensee\u2019s officers, employees, agents,\nrepresentatives, subcontractors, sublicensees, vendors, suppliers, customers,\ninvitees, or any person acting for or on behalf of the licensee, including,\nwithout limitation, any claims or actions for libel, slander, defamation,\ninvasion of privacy, unfair competition, misappropriation, trademark or\ncopyright infringement, or other related or similar claim arising from any\nbroadcasts, promotional announcements, advertisements, articles, programs or\nother materials disseminated, or activities undertaken by the licensee;  \n  \nf. Each licensee shall provide evidence of appropriate and adequate insurance\nprotection covering the licensee\u2019s indemnification obligations and any claims\nfor product liability, property damage, personal injury, bodily injury, and\ndeath arising out of or in connection with the use of indicia, which policy\nmust be renewed upon expiration for the life of the license and proof thereof\nsubmitted to the University; and  \n  \ng. The Vice President for Administration may waive any or all requirements of\nSection IV.E above, upon written request and after determining that it is in\nthe best interest of the University.  \n  \n5\\. General Licensing Guidelines (Strict compliance with these Guidelines is\nessential to protect the University in the event of I.R.S. inquiry with regard\nto the generation of unrelated trade or business taxable income I.R.S. 512 (b)\n(2), and 513 (a) (2). The Vice President of Administration may develop\nguidelines for licensing the use of the University indicia.  \n  \n6\\. Internal Processing and Controls:  \n  \na. The Licensing Administrator is designated as the control point, and the\nindividual authorized to receive all inquiries and requests to use University\nindicia that may be made or submitted to any part of the University system,\nincluding all four year and community college campuses;  \n  \nb. The Licensing Administrator shall review such proposals and work with the\nlegal, risk management, procurement or other contracting designee, and\nexternal affairs/university relations offices, as needed, to negotiate, draft\nand issue a standard non-exclusive license agreement as defined in Section\nIV.E;  \n  \nc. The Licensing Administrator shall work with the University\u2019s contracting\nofficer or the contracting officer\u2019s designee to obtain the licensee\u2019s\nsignature, finalize the issuance of the license agreement, collect the advance\nroyalties and other applicable fees and provide contract administration\nservices relating to the issued license agreement; and  \n  \nd. All license royalty revenue realized shall be placed in an account\nestablished in the University of Hawai?i commercial enterprises revolving fund\n(HRS\u00a7304A-2251) under the control of the Vice President for Administration or\nthe Vice President\u2019s designee. Distributions from this account may be made in\naccordance with \u00a7304A-2251.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe Vice President for Administration or the Vice President who\norganizationally oversees the Collegiate Licensing Office is authorized to\nadminister this policy throughout the University system.  \n\n##  V.

INTRODUCTION  \n  \nAssessment and accountability are central to the University of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s\nagenda and shared responsibilities of system/campus administrators and the\nfaculty. The University seeks to gather and produce evidence, from a variety\nof sources, about the University\u2019s effectiveness in meeting its mission and\nStrategic Plan goals and objectives. Benchmarks and performance indicators and\na variety of assessment activities are vehicles for quality improvement and\naccountability. They can serve as catalysts for change and as instruments for\ninstitutional self-reflection and planning. These activities are not ends but\nrather means to achieving learning outcomes, discovering new knowledge, and to\nserving the community.  \n  \nThis policy provides for the regular and systematic assessment of programs,\ncampuses, and the University of Hawai\u2018i System as a whole. The University has\npurposely decentralized assessment activities, while maintaining an overall\npolicy framework appropriate for a heterogeneous statewide public higher\neducation system. The fact that different University campuses, colleges,\ndepartments, and programs pursue separate assessment agendas is consistent\nwith this policy.  \n  \nB. The University of Hawai\u2018i will:  \n  \n1\\. Gather evidence about the degree to which the University of Hawai\u2018i is\neffectively accomplishing its mission and Strategic Plan goals/objectives, and\nuse this information to guide decision-making and improve University programs\nand services.  \n  \n2\\. Integrate assessment activities into the institution\u2019s ongoing planning,\nprogram review, accreditation, student services, administration, budgeting,\ntuition-setting, and other processes.  \n  \n3\\. Systematically aggregate information from a variety of sources into\ncomprehensive and meaningful information about patterns of achievement.  \n  \n4\\. Give priority to the assessment of undergraduate education.  \n  \n5\\. Address public accountability concerns and strengthen the\ninterrelationships between K-12 and postsecondary education in the State.  \n  \nC. The University of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s assessment and accountability activities will:  \n  \n1\\. Focus on overall program and institutional effectiveness and not\nindividual achievement.  \n  \n2\\. Span instructional, research, and service missions.  \n  \n3\\. Vary across program/units with differing missions, goals, and objectives.  \n  \n4\\. Be collaborative and involve appropriate faculty and staff input.  \n  \n5\\. Draw on existing data when possible.  \n  \nD. GUIDELINES  \n  \nAssessment and accountability programs/activities are designed in accordance\nwith the following guidelines  \n  \n1\\. Assessment requires and takes place in the context of the mission, goal,\nand objective statements that established the program or activity. In the case\nof undergraduate instruction, student learning objectives describe the general\nskills and abilities students are expected to acquire. Assessment focuses on\nthose outcomes deemed to be the most important.  \n  \n2\\. Undergraduate education is a major element of the University's mission and\na shared responsibility among all campuses. Each campus gives high priority to\nthe collection of information that includes:  \n  \na. Descriptive profiles of entering students, including demographic data,\nprior academic achievement, results of placement testing in key basic skills,\nand student educational expectations.  \n  \nb. Student achievement in general education, including acquired proficiency in\nkey competencies such as writing and computation skills.  \n  \nc. Student accomplishment in the major field of study.  \n  \nd. Student satisfaction with educational programs and services.  \n  \ne. Alumni demographic and employment data, including long-term satisfaction\nwith educational programs and services.  \n  \n3\\. The scholarly reputations of the UH-Manoa and UH-Hilo campuses are greatly\nenhanced by the accomplishments of their graduate and post-baccalaureate\nprofessional students. Therefore, the assessment of graduate and professional\nprograms includes student profiles that address admission patterns, student\nachievement and satisfaction, and alumni accomplishments.  \n  \n4\\. The University's research function is strengthened by a clear\nunderstanding of its goals and accomplishments. Each campus, but especially UH\nManoa, collects information relating to:  \n  \na. The effectiveness of organized research units in meeting their goals and\nobjectives.  \n  \nb. The role and accomplishments of instructional and service units in\nfurthering the University's overall research mission.  \n  \n5\\. Public confidence and internal morale are enhanced by assessment of the\nUniversity's internal organization and administrative functions along the\nfollowing lines:  \n  \na. Collective efforts that assess the effectiveness of academic program\narticulation and collect data on the long-term performance of students who\ntransfer among campuses of the University system.  \n  \nb. Campus assessment of the effectiveness of student service programs in\nsupporting student educational goals.  \n  \nc. Campus assessment of instructional support units.  \n  \nd. Assessment of faculty and staff morale.  \n  \ne. Assessment of the effectiveness of organizational structures and\nadministrative procedures in supporting clear and timely decision- making.  \n  \n6\\. Ongoing University assessment activities address the University's\neffectiveness in meeting state objectives and satisfying state needs. Examples\ninclude:  \n  \na. The University periodically ensures that campus role and mission\nresponsibilities reflect state needs.  \n  \nb. The Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation tracks,\nassesses, and reports on the level of research and training activity focused\non state needs.  \n  \nc. Each campus assesses the level of community service activity focused on\nstate and local needs.  \n  \nd. The Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs coordinates\nthe preparation of system-wide benchmark/performance indicators responsive to\nhigher education needs of the state.  \n  \ne. The Office of th Vice President for Administration assesses the\nUniversity's stewardship of its resources, including real property, equipment,\nand personnel.  \n  \nE. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \n  \n1\\. Leadership and Coordination  \n  \na. Overall policy direction is provided by the Board of Regents and the Office\nof the President.  \n  \nb. System-wide coordination and reporting are the responsibility of the UH\nOfficers and the Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.  \n  \nc. Campus/unit assessment implementation and reporting are the responsibility\nof the senior vice president/chancellors.  \n  \n2\\. Reporting Accountability and Performance Information  \n  \na. The Chancellors for M\u0101noa, Hilo and West O\u2018ahu and the Vice President for\nCommunity Colleges shall describe and update their Units\u2019 assessment\nactivities and outcomes as part of their Unit Academic Plans (commonly\nreferred to as strategic plans and required by Executive Policy EP 4.201).\nCampuses are encouraged to seek or reallocate appropriate resources in order\nto implement planned assessment activities in a timely fashion.  \nThe Vice Presidents and Chancellors designate campus administrators who have\nresponsibility for coordinating campus assessment activities. Additionally,\nthey actively encourage professional development activities designed to\nacquaint faculty and staff with assessment approaches and increase their\neffectiveness in setting appropriate objectives, administering assessment\nactivities, and analyzing and interpreting assessment information.  \n  \nb. Each campus reports assessment information in accordance with the following\nguidelines:  \n  \n(1) All reports give special attention to the difference that assessment\nactivities make by describing impacts on: student learning, curriculum/program\nchange, delivery of student services, research, service, policy, procedural\nand organizational change, planning and budgeting, accountability, information\nexchange, resource acquisition, and others.  \n  \n(2) Assessment information collected by instructional departments and programs\nis reported as part of the program review process mandated by Executive Policy\nEP 5.202 (Review of Established Programs). Program and departmental\ninformation may also be reported for use in planning and budgeting. Programs\nand departments seeking specialized accreditation report assessment\ninformation as required by the accrediting body.  \n  \n(3) Assessment/performance information is reported in accordance with the\naccreditation requirements of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.\nAdditionally, each campus incorporates applicable assessment information as a\npart of University planning and Level IV budgeting.  \n  \n(4) Baccalaureate campuses are encouraged to report to the Office of the Vice\nPresident for Community Colleges information on performance in upper division\ncourse work of UH Community College transfer students.  \n  \n(5) Each University campus provides the Department of Education with data on\nthe initial placement and first-year academic performance of recent public\nhigh school graduates in Hawai\u2018i.  \n  \n(6) Units prepare special reports on assessment and accountability as\nrequired.  \n  \n(7) Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS) 304.4-5 (Act 161) required the Board of\nRegents to adopt benchmarks tied to Master Plan goals (BOR action taken\n09/13/96), to use these benchmarks in the development of budget and tuition\nschedules for the periodic review of programs, and to submit a report to the\nLegislature in the second year of each fiscal biennium. This reporting\nrequirement is also cited in the preamble to Act 115 as an accountability\nmeasure important to greater University autonomy.  \n  \nTherefore, the Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs\nwith guidance from the UH Officers coordinates, consolidates, and prepares a\nsystem-wide benchmarks/performance indicators report in the second year of\neach fiscal biennium. The University reports on assessment results that\ndemonstrate performance relative to strategic plan goals and provide evidence\nof the institution\u2019s commitment to public accountability.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nThe objective of this executive policy is to organize UH Institutional Data\ninto data classification categories based on different levels of security risk\nand penalties that may result from the inadvertent exposure and inappropriate\ndisclosure of those data.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n  1. \u201cInstitutional Data\u201d \u2013 Data elements/data records which are created, received, maintained and/or transmitted by the University of Hawai\u2018i in the course of meeting its administrative and academic requirements.\n  \n\n  2. \u201dPersonally Identifiable Information\u201d (\u201dPII\u201d) \u2013 Data or information, or a combination of data or information that when considered together, would identify an individual. The level of security risk when managing PII varies from none to very high, depending on the data elements involved. \n  \n\n  3. \u201dPhysically Secured\u201d \u2013 The storage of electronic media or paper containing Institutional Data in a non-public, controlled area such as an area accessible only to a trusted, known group of individuals or in a locked room or file cabinet when there is no authorized individual present. Classrooms and lab areas are considered public locations.\n  \n\n  4. \u201dProtected Data\u201d \u2013 Institutional Data that are subject to security and privacy considerations that range from moderate to very high. In other words, all Institutional Data that are not considered public. Within the UH Institutional Data Classification Categories, protected data encompasses those that fall under the \u201crestricted,\u201d \u201csensitive,\u201d and \u201cregulated\u201d categories. See section III-B for category descriptions.  \nSelected data elements/data records that fall under the sensitive or regulated\ncategories may be subject to federal, state, and local regulations or industry\nstandards such as  \n\n    1. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n    2. Higher Education Act (HEA)\n    3. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)\n    4. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n    5. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n    6. Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes, Chapter 487N \u2013 Security Breach of Personal Information\n    7. Chapter 92F \u2013 Uniform Information Practices Act\n    8. PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)\n    9. NIST SP 800-171 (National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Programs)\n    10. National Industrial Security Program (NISPOM)\n    11. Bioterrorism Special Agent Program\n  \nThis policy is not intended to supersede those regulations, but to promote and\nreinforce them. Should a provision in this policy conflict with applicable\nstate, federal, or local regulations, the applicable regulation takes\nprecedence and will govern.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n###\n\n  1. POLICY STATEMENTThe University of Hawai\u2018i is committed to protecting the privacy and security of Institutional Data, one of its most valuable institutional assets.\n  \n\n###\n\n  2. DATA CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES\n    1. \u201dPublic\u201d \u2013 Institutional Data where access is not restricted and is subject to open records requests.   \nThis category includes: 1) student directory information as defined in UH\u2019s\nAdministrative Procedure, AP 7.022, Procedures Relating to Protection of the\nEducational Rights and Privacy of Students; and, 2) public employee\ninformation as defined in Hawai\u2018i Revised Statues (HRS) 92F-12 under the\nUniform Information Practices Act. See Attachment 1 for examples.\n\n  \n\n    2. \u201dRestricted\u201d \u2013 Institutional Data used for UH business only. Restricted data will not be distributed to external parties except under the terms of a written memorandum of agreement or contract. Data is maintained in a physically secured location. See Attachment 1 for examples.\n  \n\n    3. \u201dSensitive\u201d \u2013 Institutional Data subject to privacy or security considerations or any Institutional Data not designated as public, restricted, or regulated. Data is maintained in a physically secured location. See Attachment 1 for examples.\n  \n\n    4. \u201dRegulated\u201d \u2013 Institutional Data where inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access requires a breach notification in accordance with HRS \u00a7487N or is subject to financial fines. Social Security Number (SSN) and personal financial information fall within this category. Data is maintained in a physically secured location. See Attachment 1 for examples. A UH administrative procedure on breach notification procedures is forthcoming.\n  \nAttachment 1 is not intended to be an exhaustive list but is an attempt to\ncapture the more common data elements (and, in some cases, types of data) used\nby the University to conduct its daily business. Institutional Data that are\nnot listed shall be considered sensitive until otherwise determined. For\nguidance on Institutional Data not listed in Attachment 1, email\ndatagov@hawaii.edu.\n\n###\n\n  3. DATA MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES\n    1. Social Security Number (SSN) will not be used as an identifier in any University information system and its use as an identifier shall be phased out in all existing systems. This includes use of the SSN as an optional identifier in legacy systems, which is similarly prohibited. The SSN may be included as a data element in an information system only where it is required for financial processing (e.g., payroll or student tax reporting) or other uses consistent with federal and state law. For example, the University may require the use of the SSN as part of the essential process of identifying when a person has contact with the university using different names, or to distinguish between individuals who have the same name. In situations such as these, the SSN may be used only as a data element and not as an identifier. The SSN must be purged from all other information systems.\n  \n\n    2. Documents or records that contain Institutional Data from multiple classification categories will be managed according to the highest level of classification.\n  \n\n    3. Individuals with access to Protected Data must complete mandatory training and continuing education requirements. Refer to UH Administrative Procedure AP 2.215 for details.\n  \n\n    4. Lists of student directory data (which are categorized as Public) shall not be released to third parties except under the terms of a contract or memorandum of agreement. Refer to UH Administrative Procedure AP 7.022, Procedures Relating to Protection of the Educational Rights and Privacy of Students which is UH\u2019s interpretation of the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\n  \n\n    5. When displaying Protected Data in aggregate (i.e., not on an individualized basis), appropriate care must be taken to protect the identities of the individuals such that a person cannot identify any of the individuals with reasonable certainty. Note that data elements may not be personally identifiable when considered alone. However, when considered in combination with other data elements, they may reveal the identity of an individual. For example, average GPA by major may be reported. But if ethnicity is added, and there is only one individual within an ethnicity category, the identity of the individual and his/her GPA may be revealed. Therefore, appropriate consideration and measures must be taken when considering the mix of data elements being shared and the highest level of data classification category involved.\n  \n\n    6. Notwithstanding any records retention policies, paper and electronic transaction records containing Regulated data, such as SSN or personal financial information, will be redacted or removed/destroyed when considered nonessential.\n\n###\n\n  4. DATA SECURITY MEASURES\n    1. Technical guidelines for each data classification category shall be followed to prevent the inadvertent exposure and inappropriate disclosure of Institutional Data that are considered Protected Data. Technical guidelines by type of storage device are available at www.hawaii.edu/infosec/techguidelines. These technical guidelines are part of the UH Information Security Program which is administered by the Information Technology Services Information Security Team.\n  \n\n    2. Upon discovery of an inadvertent exposure or inappropriate disclosure of Protected Data, ITS\u2019 Information Security Team should be notified immediately. An investigation by the Information Security Team may be required to identify the cause(s) of the incident. Additional information on incident handling procedures are available at http://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/notification.\n  \n\n    3. As stated in Executive Policy EP 2.215, Information Technology Services (ITS) has the full authority to enforce technical measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of protected data that are stored or transmitted, whether intentionally or unintentionally, on University systems and networks, including but not limited to immediate disconnection of compromised systems and devices from the University network.\n  \n\n    4. ITS has the authority to conduct network and device scanning to identify security weaknesses in any University information system, device, or network that may compromise sensitive information or the operations and availability of institutional services.  \nITS also has the authority to require all servers operating on the University\nnetwork be regularly scanned for sensitive information, vulnerabilities and be\nprotected in accordance with appropriate data security guidelines based on\ndata classification categories.\n\n  \n\n    5. To better protect the University\u2019s Institutional Data, ITS may require departments/units/programs to periodically report on the data element/records that they manage. Reporting requirements administered by ITS include PII and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) surveys and server registrations.  \nThe PII survey is part of an HRS \u00a7487N-7 requirement where UH must annually\nprepare a report describing the information systems that contain personal\ninformation. ITS is responsible for submitting this report and maintains a\nsecure online system for units to report such systems. Chancellors and Vice\nPresidents are responsible to ensure that units under their purview report\nsystems containing Protected Data and update the information at least\nannually.\n\n  \n\n    6. Chancellors and Vice Presidents should also designate an individual in their organization to be responsible for the units\u2019 personal information protection and compliance program which includes ensuring that the PII survey is completed accurately, that the unnecessary storage of personal information is eliminated, and that appropriate security measures for systems under their purview are implemented. The individual\u2019s name, and contact information shall be sent to the UH Chief Information Security Officer. These designated individuals will form the systemwide Data Security Leadership Council.\n  \n\n    7. The UH Board of Regents approved a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Red Flags Rule Identity Theft Prevention Program for UH. The program falls under the FTC\u2019s Red Flags Rule, 16 CFR Part 681, which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. The purpose of the Identity Theft Prevention Program is to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with a \u201ccovered account\u201d which involves the University extending credit to an individual to obtain goods or services, or accepting a deposit from the individual, and involves multiple payments or transactions. See Attachment II for details.\n  \n\n    8. Personnel related actions  \n\n      1. Terminations  \nWhen an employee with access to Protected Data voluntarily separates from the\nUniversity, his/her access will be revoked at the time of separation. The\nappointing authority shall be responsible for initiating the revocation of\naccess.  \nIn the case of an employer-initiated termination of employment of personnel\nwith access to Protected Data, access may, as circumstances warrant, be\nrevoked immediately at the time of notification, or as soon as may be\nconsistent with an applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n\n  \n\n      2. Violations  \nIn the event of an inadvertent exposure or inappropriate disclosure of\nProtected Data, the chancellor or vice president of the affected unit will be\ninformed.

Definitions\n\n###\n\n  1. \u201cData Sharing Request Process\u201d \u2013 A process that governs the release of Institutional Data and provides an understanding of how the data is being used, by whom, and where it is being copied and stored.\n  \n\n  2. \u201cData Users\u201d \u2013 All UH employees, students, and affiliates who, in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities, require access to UH Institutional Data.\n  \n\n  3. \u201cDepartmental/Unit/Local Data Repositories\u201d \u2013 Various UH academic and administrative departments or units copy Institutional Data from Institutional Data Systems into their own departmental, unit, or local data repositories. Any Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repository that contains a copy of Institutional Data are subject to the same policies and procedures which govern the use of Institutional Data. This policy applies to all repositories of Institutional Data, irrespective of where the repository is maintained (for example, a department may contract for cloud storage services to maintain its data repository).  \n\u201cDepartmental/Unit/Local Data Repositories\u201d \u2013 Various UH academic and\nadministrative departments or units copy Institutional Data from Institutional\nData Systems into their own departmental, unit, or local data repositories.\nAny Departmental/Unit/Local Data Repository that contains a copy of\nInstitutional Data are subject to the same policies and procedures which\ngovern the use of Institutional Data. This policy applies to all repositories\nof Institutional Data, irrespective of where the repository is maintained (for\nexample, a department may contract for cloud storage services to maintain its\ndata repository).\n\n  \n\n  4. \u201cInstitutional Data\u201d \u2013 Data elements which are created, received, maintained and/or transmitted by the University of Hawai\u2018i in the course of meeting its administrative and academic requirements.  \nInstitutional Data may be  \n\n    1. contained in any form, including but not limited to documents, databases, spreadsheets, email, and websites;\n  \n\n    2. represented in any form, including but not limited to letters, numbers, words, pictures, videos, sounds, symbols, or any combination thereof;\n  \n\n    3. communicated in any form, including but not limited to handwriting, printing, photocopying, photographing, and web publishing; and\n  \n\n    4. recorded upon any form, including but not limited to papers, maps, films, prints, discs, drives, memory sticks, and other information systems.\n  \n\n  5. \u201cInstitutional Data Systems\u201d \u2013 UH systemwide data repositories that collect and store both transactional (operational) and reporting types of Institutional Data, including Systems of Record. In some cases, Institutional Data may be purged on a regular basis from an Institutional Data System. Institutional Data Systems are subject to the same policies and procedures that govern the use of Institutional Data. Examples of Institutional Data Systems are the Banner Student Information System, PeopleSoft, Kuali Financial System, STAR, Laulima, etc.  \nA list of Institutional Data Systems and associated System Executive Data\nStewards is available on the UH data governance website. Note the list is not\nintended to be all-inclusive of the University\u2019s Institutional Data Systems,\nbut rather, represents Institutional Data Systems that are most likely to\ncontain Protected Data.\n\n  \n\n  6. \u201cProtected Data\u201d \u2013 Institutional Data that are subject to security and privacy considerations that range from moderate to very high (i.e., all non-public data). These data fall under the Institutional Data Classification Categories of \u201crestricted,\u201d \u201csensitive,\u201d and \u201cregulated.\u201d For more information, refer to Executive Policy EP 2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines.\n  \n\n  7. \u201cSystem of Record\u201d \u2013 Institutional Data that are designated by a Data Steward as representing official values of the University. Official values are the data designated as the most accurate representation of the meaning and context of Institutional Data elements, which are recorded as facts. Official values are not necessarily the originally entered values, and as such, a System of Record may not necessarily be the system where values are originally entered. When questions arise over the meaning or interpretation of data elements or their values, the System of Record is used to resolve discrepancies.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n###\n\n  1. POLICY STATEMENTThe University holds itself accountable for the privacy and security of its Institutional Data and other data under its stewardship while keeping that data accessible for appropriate use. The data governance program strives to achieve this by fostering a culture of shared responsibility and active participation among members of the University community.\n  \n\n###\n\n  2. GOALSThe goals of data governance at the University are to:  \n  \n\n    1. Protect the privacy and security of data and information under the stewardship of the University;\n  \n\n    2. Support a culture of responsible data use for informed and actionable decision making;\n  \n\n    3. Establish systemwide standards that enable holistic understanding of data across institutional boundaries;\n  \n\n    4. Promote the efficient use of resources to meet the data and information needs of the University community;\n  \n\n    5. Increase the University\u2019s transparency and accountability to external stakeholders and the public by promoting access to relevant information.\n\n###\n\n  3. SCOPEThe scope of this institutional data governance policy applies to the following:  \n  \n\n    1. Individuals employed by the University or any affiliates (including external agencies such as RCUH, Sodexo, third party vendors, etc.) with access to University-related data and information (i.e., Institutional Data);\n  \n\n    2. All Institutional Data created, collected, analyzed, and reported on by UH units as part of their administrative and academic functions, regardless of where they are located and in what medium they are stored (e.g., physical or electronic), how they are accessed, and how they are transmitted;\n  \n\n    3. Institutional Data, such as student demographics, used in surveys or studies\n  \n\n    4. Protected Data that has been created, collected, or analyzed for the purpose of research.\n  \nThis policy recognizes the legal responsibilities of individual campuses to\nprotect the privacy and security of their students\u2019 data according to FERPA\nrequirements.\n\n###\n\n  4. PRINCIPLESThe following principles are set forth as minimum standards to govern the appropriate use and management of Institutional Data.  \n  \n\n    1. Institutional Data is the property of the University of Hawai\u2018i and shall be managed as a key asset through defined governance standards, policies, and procedures.\n  \n\n    2. Institutional Data will be safeguarded and protected according to security, privacy, and compliance rules and regulations established by the federal and state government (see section I-B), and University of Hawai\u2018i policies. This University of Hawai\u2018i executive policy is not intended to supercede federal and state rules and regulations, but to promote and reinforce them.\n  \n\n    3. Access to Institutional Data will be based on defined roles. Users deemed to have a legitimate educational interest will be assigned appropriate access based on their roles.\n  \n\n    4. Institutional representatives will be held accountable to their roles and responsibilities. Roles and responsibilities involving the management and use of Institutional Data will be clearly defined, and individuals assigned to specific roles will be held accountable for their data management responsibilities.\n  \n\n    5. The use, storage, and exposure of protected data will be minimized whenever possible.\n  \n\n    6. The University strives to ensure the safety and security of its employees and its data assets. It will employ strategies in multiple ways, including the use of technology, physical space, etc. The strategies will take into consideration the privacy of individuals and the protection of data based on the level of sensitivity.\n  \n\n    7. The University\u2019s technical resources will be used for institutional purposes only and not for personal and/or private gain or for malicious intent.\n\n###\n\n  5. BEST PRACTICES\n    1. Minimal access will be granted to Data Users. Individuals, including non-UH personnel (e.g., third party contractors), will be granted the most restrictive set of permissions and privileges based on feasibility and a need-to-know. Not only will the minimal level of access to perform an operation be granted, that access will be granted only for the duration of time necessary to complete the operation.\n  \n\n    2. Disclosure of Institutional Data that are considered protected and personally identifiable will be based on a need to know. When possible, Institutional Data being disclosed will be de-identified.\n  \n\n    3. Quality standards for Institutional Data will be defined, implemented, monitored, and communicated by System Executive Data Stewards of Institutional Data Systems (defined in sections II, Definitions and III-F, Roles and Responsibilities). Examples of data quality standards include: data validation rules, timeliness of updates, defined error rates, etc.\n  \n\n    4. Unnecessary duplication of Institutional Data is discouraged. Maintaining repositories of redundant data increases the risk of inadvertent disclosure or inappropriate access to Institutional Data. Executive Data Stewards and Data Custodians (defined in section III-F, Roles and Responsibilities) will exercise responsible records management practices, including minimizing redundant storage where reasonable and appropriate.\n  \n\n    5. Data Users will complete mandatory training requirements on the appropriate handling of Protected Data before they are allowed access. For more information, refer to AP 2.215, Mandatory Training and Continuing Education Requirements for Data Users.\n  \n\n    6. Resolution of issues related to Institutional Data will follow consistent and public processes. The Data Governance Committee (DGC) will coordinate the resolution of issues related to risks, costs, access, management, and use of Institutional Data with the appropriate Data Stewards and with UH leadership.\n  \n\n    7. Institutional Data will only be released for student surveys that are being administered for institutional purposes (such as improving services for students) and/or for the benefit students. Campuses make the final decision on which surveys student contact information will be released.  \nAs part of the Data Sharing Request Process, requests involving the release of\nInstitutional Data for student surveys will require an affirmative response\nfrom each Campus Executive Data Steward.\n\n  \n\n    8. Institutional Data that was requested through the Data Sharing Request Process for a specific purpose cannot be used for another purpose.\n  \n\n    9. UH data agreements involving software and/or services and the collection, management, sharing, exchange, use and/or release of Protected Data must meet the principles and best practices set forth in this policy, along with provisions in EP 8.200, Policy on Contracts and Signing Authority. Such agreements include, but are not limited to, vendor contracts, subscriptions, and memoranda of agreements/understanding. Appendix 9 of EP 8.200 features a template \u201cData Sharing Protections and Requirements\u201d that can be incorporated into data agreements, as needed.\n  \n\n    10. Guidelines and procedures for the effective management of Institutional Data throughout its lifecycle (from creation to destruction) will be established. Guidelines and procedures involving the creation or acquisition, storage and maintenance, use, archival, and destruction of Institutional Data will be available to direct Data Users and Data Custodians in their data management practices.\n  \n\n    11. Activities that reduce the potential exposure of sensitive information will be implemented through an information security program. The University will establish an information security program that addresses the following areas, including, but not limited to, governance structures, security audits, risk assessments, identity management, access controls, education and training, and network monitoring. The program will perform ongoing audits of high risk areas and enforce remediation measures, as necessary.\n  \n\n    12. Contingency plans for managing security breaches and disaster recovery will be established. The process for managing security breaches and other inappropriate uses of Institutional Data will be addressed in University policy. Types of information included will be a definition of a security breach, guidelines on the timing, contents, and means of notice to affected parties, etc. Disaster recovery plans will include contingencies for the physical security of affected sites containing Protected Data.\n  \n\n    13. Accessing Institutional Data remotely (for example, off-campus) will be done in a secure manner. Individuals who will be electronically accessing Institutional Data from a location other than their usual work areas will ensure they are not using unprotected or public wireless connections.\n\n###\n\n  6. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIESThe following roles and responsibilities are defined, for both individuals and groups, for the purpose of establishing clear governance and accountabilities over Institutional Data. The terms and conditions for appointments and assignments are outlined for each. Note that for University employees whose duties and responsibilities fall within a controlled access environment, this policy should not impact their daily activities, but rather, should clarify and formalize their roles and responsibilities.  \n  \n\n    1.

Campus FERPA Officer \u2013 The campus registrar serves as a campus-wide technical resource and subject matter expert on FERPA issues, and provides interpretation as needed.\n  \n\n    8. Data Stewards \u2013 Data Stewards act in accordance and ensure compliance with applicable federal and state rules and regulations and University policies involving Institutional Data. Data Stewards are responsible for minimizing the use, storage, and exposure of Protected Data, particularly personally identifiable information. They are expected to limit the exposure of such data to only situations that are deemed essential and appropriate.   \n  \nThere are two levels of Data Stewards at the University of Hawai\u2018i: executive\nand functional.  \n  \n\n      1. Executive Data Stewards are accountable for the use and management of Institutional Data at their respective campus or within the Institutional Data System under their purview.  \n  \n\n        1. Campus Executive Data Stewards  \n  \n\n          1. These Data Stewards are vice chancellors or appropriate administrators responsible for the major functional areas within a campus including, but not limited to, student affairs, academic affairs, and administration. They have the authority to govern the use of Institutional Data within their respective areas.\n  \n\n          2. Campus Executive Data Stewards for student data have the responsibility of reviewing and approving data sharing requests within their respective campuses. As part of the review process, a Campus Executive Data Steward will notify relevant parties of data sharing requests for student-related data through an inclusive and open communication process. Human resource and financial data sharing requests are managed centrally by the UH System Offices of Human Resources and Financial Management.\n  \n\n        2. System Executive Data Stewards  \n  \n\n          1. These Data Stewards are primarily system level executives with functional responsibility for Institutional Data Systems (see section II, Definitions). They have the authority to govern the use of Institutional Data within these Institutional Data Systems.\n  \n\n          2. System Executive Data Stewards review and approve Data Sharing Requests involving multiple campuses, external parties, and/or electronic linkages to Institutional Data Systems. As part of the review process, the System Executive Data Steward will notify relevant parties of Data Sharing Requests through an inclusive and open communication process.\n  \n\n          3.

System Executive Data Stewards have the additional responsibility of responding to the data and information needs of the University community through the Institutional Data Systems they oversee. They sponsor and promote a shared understanding of data through clear data element definitions, and oversee data quality and performance improvements within these systems.\n  \nRefer to the UH Data Governance website for a listing of Institutional Data\nSystems and associated Executive Data Stewards.\n\n  \n\n      2. Functional Data Stewards are responsible for the day-to-day use, management, and distribution of Institutional Data. Functional Data Stewards exist among all levels and across all units within the University. Registrars, financial aid officers, fiscal managers, human resources specialists, and institutional researchers are among those considered Data Stewards.   \n  \nFunctional Data Stewards engage in the following types of data related\nactivities:  \n  \n\n        1. Ensure Institutional Data is managed appropriately, according to policies and procedures;\n  \n\n        2. Recommend enhancements for their respective program areas to improve data quality, access, security, performance, and reporting;\n  \n\n        3. Serve as a conduit between functional and technical personnel to promote communication and a shared understanding of requirements;\n  \n\n        4. Fulfill Data Sharing Requests.\n  \n\n    9. Data Custodians \u2013 Data Custodians are the managers and/or administrators of systems or media on which protected data reside, including, but not limited to, personal computers, laptop computers, PDAs, smartphones, departmental servers, enterprise databases, storage systems, magnetic tapes, CDs/DVDs, USB drives, paper files, and any other removable or portable devices or off-site storage technologies. These may include, but are not limited to, cloud storage or cloud services. Information technology personnel are commonly regarded as Data Custodians, however, any authorized individual who downloads or stores sensitive information onto a computer or other storage device becomes a Data Custodian through that act.  \n  \nData Custodians are responsible for the technical safeguarding of protected\ndata, including implementing and administering controls that ensure the\ntransmission of those protected data are secure and access controls are in\nplace to prevent inappropriate disclosure. This can be as simple as utilizing\nUH FileDrop to transfer Protected Data.\n\n  \n\n    10. Data Users \u2013 UH employees, students, and affiliates who, in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities, require access to protected data as defined in Executive Policy EP 2.214, Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines. Data Users are responsible for understanding and complying with applicable University policies and procedures and all recognized federal and state laws for dealing with protected data.  \nTo ensure compliance and to meet the objectives of this policy, individuals\nmust complete training requirements as outlined in AP 2.215, Mandatory\nTraining and Continuing Education Requirements for Data Users. Those who do\nnot comply will be denied access. Specific questions about the appropriate\nhandling or usage of Institutional Data should be directed to the Executive\nData Steward responsible for that area.\n\n  \n\n##  IV.

University Unit \u2013 For purposes of this policy, University unit means any campus, college, school, department, or unit of the University of Hawai\u2018i.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n###\n\n  1. PolicyThe University is committed to effective records management to meet legal and institutional requirements, optimize space usage, minimize the risk of unauthorized exposure of information, and minimize the cost of record retention.\n  \n\n###\n\n  2. ScopeThis policy applies to all records, regardless of medium or characteristics, that are owned, created, or produced by the University in the conduct of official business of the University.\n  \n\n###\n\n  3. ResponsibilitiesEach University unit responsible for records management is required to:  \n\n    1. Manage and store records in a safe, stable, and secure manner that facilitates timely and accurate retrieval, establishes appropriate controls on accessibility, and adheres to applicable laws, regulations, and policies;\n  \n\n    2. Evaluate records for their administrative, organizational, legal, fiscal, historical, or archival value to ensure the appropriate retention period is applied to University records;\n  \n\n    3. Determine the confidentiality and privacy status of records and ensure proper security measures based upon the level of confidentiality and privacy involved;\n  \n\n    4. Allow only those with proper authority to access records;\n  \n\n    5. Conduct periodic reviews and evaluations of records management, storage, and security systems;\n  \n\n    6. Know, document, and inventory the location of all records and security procedures applicable thereto;\n  \n\n    7. Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and policies regarding records management;\n  \n\n    8. Annually update the State of Hawai\u2018i Records Report System (RRS) administered by the State of Hawai\u2018i Office of Information Practices (OIP) in accordance with HRS 92F-18(b); and\n  \n\n    9. Designate an individual within the University unit that is the keeper (_i.e._ , custodian) of the official University record to assist the unit in fulfilling its records management responsibilities.\n  \n\n###\n\n  4. Electronic Records Conversion\n    1. Each University unit is encouraged to convert hard copy records to electronic records where practicable; provided, however, that original documents deemed to contain intrinsic value by the University archivist may need to be retained in original paper format.\n  \n\n    2. When creating an electronic version of an original paper document, a University Unit shall ensure that the electronic version accurately reflects the information set forth in the original paper document.\n  \n\n    3. Recommended scanning specifications for documents are located at https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/records-management/.\n  \n\n    4. The electronic version of an original paper document, once scanned, shall be recognized by the University as an official business record. The electronic copy shall be deemed to be an original record for all purposes, pursuant to HRS \u00a792-30.\n  \n\n    5. Original paper documents may be destroyed after scanning, provided the scanned document has been verified as accurate, readable, and retrievable for later reference. Considerations for digitizing paper documents are located at https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/records-management/.\n  \n\n###\n\n  5. Records Retention and Disposition\n    1. Records shall be retrievable and accessible in a timely manner throughout their retention period.\n  \n\n    2. Retention concepts for electronic records are the same as those for non-electronic records.\n  \n\n    3. Retention concepts are inapplicable to duplicates. Duplicates of original records shall be disposed of at the end of their useful life, regardless of whether the minimum retention periods set forth in records retention schedules have been met. Any University unit retaining duplicates should be aware that it must still comply with applicable records storage and protection responsibilities as set forth in Section III.C of this Policy.\n  \n\n    4. When records have satisfied their required period of retention, they shall be disposed of in an appropriate and secure manner that does not allow for reconstruction or re-identification of such records. Guidelines for disposal are available at: https://www.hawaii.edu/infosec/techguidelines/disposal/.\n  \n\n    5. Records transmitted pursuant to an agreement, including, without limitation, any Hawai\u2018i Data Exchange Partnership agreements, shall be disposed of pursuant to the terms and conditions of such agreement.\n  \n\n    6. Records covered by the State General Records Schedules (GRS) shall be disposed of without further concurrence from the State Comptroller as long as the minimum retention periods set forth in the schedules have been met. The GRS is located at http://ags.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GRS-2002-revised-5-06.pdf.\n  \n\n    7. Records covered by the following records schedules, which have been approved by the State Comptroller pursuant to HRS \u00a794-3, shall be disposed of without further concurrence from the State Comptroller as long as the minimum retention periods set forth in the schedules have been met:  \n\n      1. Student Records Schedule (Appendix 1)\n      2. Children\u2019s Centers Schedule (Appendix 2)\n  \nThese retention schedules are also located at\nhttps://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/records-management/.\n\n  \n\n    8. Records not covered by an approved records retention schedule will not be disposed of without the prior approval of the State Comptroller as prescribed in HRS \u00a794-3. The Records Inventory Form (Form ARM-6) shall be submitted to the State Records Center director who will then review and recommend approval to the State Comptroller.\n  \n\n    9. Records to be transferred to other state agencies or the State Archives shall be transferred in accordance with applicable rules, policies, and procedures of the State Records Center and/or the Archives Division, Records Management Branch, Department of Accounting and General Services.\n  \n\n    10. Records shall be subject to a litigation hold when the University is aware of pending or threatened litigation or audits involving the University. Records with a litigation hold shall not be destroyed until the legal action or audit is completed, regardless of whether the retention period has expired. The unit that is the keeper (_i.e._ , custodian) of the official University record shall be responsible for ensuring litigation holds are imposed and appropriate action is taken to prevent spoliation, destruction or alteration of records.\n  \n\n    11. Record retention for extramurally financed research and training programs/activities shall be in accordance with AP 8.926.\n  \n\n    12. The Data Governance Office may be contacted for assistance in determining the applicable records retention schedule or for other assistance regarding records management.\n  \n\n###\n\n  6. Electronic Approval/Signature\n    1. Pursuant to HRS 489E-7, a record or signature shall not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.\n  \n\n    2. Where a University policy requires that a record or electronic document have the approval/signature of a responsible person, that requirement is met when the electronic record has associated with it an electronic signature.  \n  \nElectronic authentication occurs when an electronic document is associated\nwith an electronic signature or when a record is associated with a unique\nidentifier such as a UH Username. Electronic authentication is required for\nestablishing nonrepudiation (a guarantee that the owner of the signature\ncannot deny responsibility for the activity).\n\n  \n\n    3. Electronic signatures shall meet the following requirements:  \n\n      1. Unique to person using the electronic signature, _i.e._ , Personal Digital Certificate or Login ID/Password.\n  \n\n      2. Capable of verification (Part of record\u2019s data structure).\n  \n\n      3. Under the sole control of person using the electronic signature.\n  \n\n      4. Sufficient controls shall be in place to provide an audit trail and to ensure that the electronic signature and their link to the respective record cannot be removed, copied, or otherwise manipulated to falsify an electronic record.\n  \n\n    4. An electronic signature used outside of its limitations will not be considered valid by the University.\n  \n\n    5. Any individual that makes inappropriate or illegal use of electronic signatures and/or records shall be subject to sanctions as provided by applicable law, rule, policy, or collective bargaining agreement.\n  \n\n###\n\n  7. Public Inspection of University Records\n    1. Issues relating to the required disclosure or nondisclosure of University records are governed by Chapter 92F, Hawai\u2018i Revised Statues (Uniform Information Practices Act or UIPA), and certain federal laws and regulations.\n  \n\n    2. Each University campus shall designate a coordinator responsible for receiving, managing, and responding to records requests made to units within the campus (Campus Coordinator). The Campus Coordinator shall be knowledgeable regarding UIPA and any implementing regulations of the State Office of Information Practices (OIP). The Campus Coordinator\u2019s contact information (including email address, phone number, and physical mailing address) shall be posted on the website of each University campus and shall be provided to the UH Communications Office and updated no less than annually. The UH Communications Office shall be responsible for providing updated Campus Coordinator information to OIP and otherwise satisfying any other reporting requirements related to UIPA.\n  \n\n    3. The Campus Coordinator may seek legal assistance from the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs and University General Counsel in determining whether a record is subject to public disclosure.\n  \n\n    4. Records requests related in any way to threatened, pending, or existing litigation matters shall be directed to the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs and University General Counsel.\n  \n\n###\n\n  8. Retention of Personally Identifiable InformationNothing in this Procedure shall require, promote or support the retention of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) such as credit card information and social security numbers in University records. In accordance with Executive Policy EP 2.214 (Institutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security Guidelines), PII may be collected only when necessary to meet specific institutional requirements and shall be maintained in secured areas with access limited to authorized users. All PII shall be removed or redacted from University records once the requirements for having collected that information have been met.\n\n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nThis revised executive policy is the successor to E4.201 dated July 1985. This\npolicy provides guidance in the fulfillment of Chapter 4, Board of Regents\nPolicies relating to (1) the purposes of university planning; (2) the planning\nconcepts and processes that provide the foundation for University of Hawai\u2019i\nplanning; (3) the major components (outcomes/documents) of long-range planning\nat the University; (4) assessment and evaluation activities; (5) lead\nresponsibility for planning implementation; and (6) the planning calendar.  \n  \nAs the lead for system-level strategic planning, the Office of the Vice\nPresident for Academic Affairs shall collaborate with Office of the Vice\nPresident for Administration and other system level offices in the\nimplementation of this policy.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Purposes of University Planning  \n  \nThe University of Hawaii (UH) is committed to planning that addresses current\nand long-term educational needs and challenges of this institution, the state,\nand society at large. The purposes of University planning are to advance:  \n  \n1\\. A shared direction and purpose among all segments of the University,\nconsistent with the University's system mission, the missions of major Units1,\nthe operative University system plan, and in support of formally stated\npriorities of the state; and  \n  \n2\\. The integration of major Unit academic plans, subunit academic plans,\nprogram plans, facilities plans, capital and operating budget plans,\naccreditation reports, and related planning, assessment, and evaluation\ndocuments and processes.  \n  \nB. Planning Concepts and Processes  \n  \nUniversity of Hawai\u2019i planning links planning and budgeting, is responsive to\nits planning environment and diverse campus missions, involves collaborative\nprocesses, and is informed by relevant data and information.  \n  \n1\\. Links Planning and Budgeting. A major objective of University planning is\nto ensure that planning results are considered and reflected as appropriate in\nbudget priorities.  \n  \n2\\. Responsive to the Planning Environment. Achieving shared directions and\npurposes that are responsive to significant local, regional, national, and\nglobal trends and needs is critical to the success of the University\u2019s\neducational planning process.  \n  \n3\\. Responsive to Diverse Campus Missions. Long- range planning within the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2019i is tailored to the needs of a heterogeneous system of\ncampuses. Differences in mission, size, stage of development, etc., mean that\nsystem policies and guidelines must be flexible, recognizing that one planning\nprocess will not fit all.  \n  \n4\\. Collaborative Processes. A central objective of UH planning is broad\nparticipation of faculty, staff, students, and managers resulting in\ndecentralized implementation within common parameters. Universities are\ndistinctive for their collegial, open, and participatory management style.\nPlanning in this setting is characterized by consultation and review that\ncombine the best of bottom-up and top-down approaches.  \n  \nExecutive leadership is ultimately responsible for developing, in consultation\nwith University constituents, common planning parameters (system and campus\nmission and role statements, overall goals, planning principles and\nassumptions, and major policies). These parameters set the ground rules and\nprovide the substantive framework within which plans at all levels are\nexpected to fit. The common planning parameters are updated as needed and\nbroadly disseminated across the University system. Executive leaders are also\nresponsible for managing the overall planning process and, with appropriate\nconsultation, for the preparation of plans for system wide functions and\nactivities.  \n  \nCollaborative planning requires decentralized planning by subunits and\nimplementation by line, mid-level, and program managers who assume ultimate\nresponsibility for the operation of their programs in concert with the common\nplanning parameters.  \n  \nThis allocation of responsibility does not eliminate the need for review and\napproval of program plans by executive managers and the Board of Regents. Such\nreviews are needed to insure conformance with the basic assumptions and\nexisting University policies as well as to identify gaps and overlaps among\nthe various plans. In addition, subsequent reviews ensure that plans are\nrealistic, setting forth appropriate and efficient use of limited resources.  \n  \n5\\. Informed by Data and Information. University planning is supported and\ninformed by a variety of management information and assessment reports that\ndescribes the University internal and external planning environment and\nprovides information on how well the institution is achieving its overall\ngoals. These reports are prepared in a timely and routine manner.  \n  \nC. Major Planning Components  \n  \nThe University of Hawai\u2019i planning system involves a core set of interrelated\nplans. Typically each document provides a guide to more detailed planning at\none level and a mechanism for integrating that level into a coherent\nrelationship with the broader objectives and policies that exist at more\ncomprehensive levels of planning. The major University of Hawai\u2019i planning\ndocuments are described below and summarized in Attachment 2, and their\ninterrelationships are illustrated in Charts 1 and 2.  \n  \n1\\. Mission Statement. The \u201cUniversity of Hawai\u2019i Mission\u201d articulates those\nqualities common to the system (the overall vision and purpose, values,\ngovernance structure, special emphasis on access, and the system\u2019s distinctive\nHawaiian/Asian/Pacific role). Within this overall mission, the separate and\nunique role and mission statements for UH Manoa, UH Hilo, UH-West O\u2019ahu, and\nthe UH Community Colleges are set forth.  \n  \n2\\. System Plan. This document is typically called the University Strategic or\nMaster Plan. The University\u2019s current operative comprehensive system planning\ndocument is Focus on Quality: University of Hawai\u2019i Strategic Plan, 1997-\n2007. It sets forth common system goals and planning principles, and system\nand Unit- specific action strategies. Together these articulate the priorities\nof the University of Hawai\u2019i system for the planning period.  \n  \n3\\. Unit Academic Plans. Like the system plan, these plans are also typically\ncalled strategic plans2. The planning unit distinguishes these plans from the\nmore comprehensive system plan. Unit academic plans are prepared for the four\nmajor Units of the UH system (Manoa, Hilo, West O\u2019ahu, and the Community\nColleges as one entity). Unit academic plans elaborate each Unit's special\nmission, unique internal and external circumstances, and strategies and\npriorities designed to implement the system plan. At Manoa, Hilo, and West\nO\u2019ahu, these plans are the basis for physical facilities development.\nGuidelines for formatting Unit academic plans are provided as Attachment 3.  \n  \n4\\. Subunit Academic Plans. These plans are typically referred to as Academic\nDevelopment Plans or ADPs3. They are prepared for each UH Community College,\nthe colleges, schools, and major institutes at UH Manoa, and other major\ncampus and/or system academic entities or functions as deemed appropriate.\nThese academic plans provide, at a finer level of detail, specific priorities\nand action strategies for implementing both the more comprehensive Unit and\nsystem plans. Academic plans guide the development of individual academic\nprograms and are coordinated, as appropriate, with accreditation self studies.\nAt the Community Colleges, they also guide the development of physical\nfacilities. Guidelines for formatting subunit academic plans are provided as\nAttachment 4.  \n  \n5\\. Program Plans. These documents reflect the priorities contained in subunit\nacademic plans. They involve needs assessment and a summary of specific\nprogram priorities and resource requirements. The establishment of new\nacademic programs and the review of existing programs are governed by separate\nBoard of Regents Policy RP 5.201 and Executive Policies EP 5.201 and EP 5.202.  \n  \n6\\. Facilities Development Plans. These plans are typically called Long-Range\nDevelopment Plans (LRDPs). They are the basis for campus facilities \u201cmaster\nplanning\u201d; they specify the detailed physical plant requirements and CIP\nprojects needed to accommodate academic program development at each campus\nand, if appropriate, for major programs located off-campus.  \n  \n7\\. Board and Executive Policies, Administrative Procedures, Contractual\nLanguage, and Federal Compliance Requirements. Official UH policies and\nprocedures and all applicable external compliance requirements direct and\nguide decision making across the full spectrum of University activities.\nUniversity plans must conform to these official promulgations and\nrequirements.  \n  \n8\\. Biennium Priorities. These priorities direct the preparation of the\nUniversity's biennium budget and are based on biennium updates of Unit and\nsubunit priorities. At the System level, biennium priorities typically are\nexpressed as operating and CIP budget objectives or in some comparable format.  \n  \nD. Assessment and Evaluation Activities  \n  \nA variety of assessment and evaluation activities and documents supports the\nUniversity's planning framework. Some of the more prominent are described\nhere.  \n  \n1\\. Budget Hearings. At an early stage of the biennium budget preparation\nprocess, budget hearings/meetings take place within the Units. The overall\npurpose of these sessions is to assess progress and to clarify and establish\nbiennium planning assumptions and priorities. Outcomes must be consistent with\npriorities established in University system and Unit plans. Budget hearings\nare typically held for major subunits corresponding to the subunit academic\nplan requirement described above. For each biennium, the specific hearings to\nbe held and their schedule and format are determined by the senior vice\npresident and chancellor or executive vice chancellor. The President\nestablishes a mechanism for integrating the Unit priorities that emerge from\nthese budget hearings into biennium priorities for the University as a whole.  \n  \n2\\. Benchmarks/Performance Indicators. These analyses and reports monitor\ninstitutional progress relative to measures that are typically linked to\noverall goals and objectives. Results provide useful insights on plan outcomes\nover time and/or relative to standards or peer performance. A system report is\nprepared on a biennium basis as an early component of the budget preparation\nprocess. At the Unit, subunit, and program levels, more detailed performance\nmeasures and/or health indicators are developed and used to support long-term\nand biennium priority setting.  \n  \n3\\. Program Reviews. These are required in Board of Regents Policy RP 5.201\nand Executive Policies EP 5.201 and EP 5.202. They are assessments of program\nstatus (needs, accomplishments, areas for improvement, etc.); they address the\nextent to which an established program has met stated objectives at levels of\nquality that justify its continuation. They also consider whether program\nobjectives are still appropriate to the campus, Unit, and overall University\nmissions. Program review results receive serious consideration in the academic\nplanning process.  \n  \n4\\. Accreditation Self-Studies. These are prepared in accordance with\nstandards and review cycles dictated by accrediting associations. A self-study\ntypically addresses the extent to which an institution or professional program\nis operating consistent with established standards. Self-studies and visiting\nteam reports aid in determining whether an institution or program offers its\nstudents the educational opportunities implied in its objectives at a\nsatisfactory level and is likely to continue to do so. Results of\naccreditation are incorporated into academic plans as appropriate.  \n  \n5\\. Management and Planning Information Reports and Survey Results. These\nanalyses typically translate data into information on enrollments, student\ncharacteristics, courses, curriculum, tuition, finances and expenditures,\nfaculty and staff, institutional comparisons, etc. Reports are prepared\nroutinely (e.g., semester or annual) or on an ad hoc basis. A variety of\nsurvey results are also available to support planning processes.  \n  \nE. Implementation Responsibility  \n  \n1\\. In summary, implementation of the University of Hawai\u2019i\u2019s integrated\nplanning framework is based on the directions of updated system and Unit\nmission statements and the comprehensive system plan. Using the collaborative\nprocesses described earlier, responsibility for preparing these documents\nresides with the Office of the President and involves all senior executives.  \n  \n2\\. Unit and subunit academic plans, consistent with established missions and\ndesigned to implement the comprehensive system plan, are developed under the\noverall leadership of the appropriate vice president and chancellor or vice\nchancellor. Again, utilizing the broad-based collaborative process described\nearlier, vice chancellors, deans, and senior directors have lead\nresponsibility for the preparation of their subunit academic plans.  \n  \n3\\. Lead responsibility for the development of comprehensive campus facilities\nplans (LRDPs) is a joint responsibility of the vice president for\nadministration and the appropriate chancellor.  \n  \nF. Planning Calendar  \n  \n1\\. Generally, a review of mission is undertaken every 10 to 15 years or when\nmajor new units are added to the system or there is a significant change in\nthe role and responsibility of existing units. The updated mission statement\nadopted by the Board of Regents in November 1996 replaced the prior 1982\nmission statement.  \n  \n2\\. The University's comprehensive system plan typically spans 10 years and is\nupdated as needed during that time. The current system plan was approved by\nthe Board in November 1996.  \n  \n3\\. Unit Academic Plans and Subunit Academic Plans typically span the time\nframe of the University system plan.

The President or President's designee will set necessary areas of health\ninsurance coverage as well as amounts of coverage for all non-immigrant UH\nstudents on student visas, using federal and state regulations as well as\ninput from the system and campus senior student affairs officers .  \n  \nB. The health insurance plan/policy for non-immigrant students on student\nvisas must meet ALL of the following minimum coverage requirements (all\namounts are in USD). Vision/dental coverage is not required. The plan:  \n  \n1\\. Should provide comprehensive medical coverage of at least $100,000 US per\naccident or illness;  \n  \n2\\. Should provide repatriation coverage of at least $25,000 US;  \n  \n3\\. Should provide medical evacuation coverage to home country of at least\n$10,000 US;  \n  \n4\\. Should provide inpatient/outpatient medical & mental health coverage at no\nless than 75% of usual/customary charge (UCC);  \n  \n5\\. May require a waiting period of pre-existing conditions which is\nreasonable under current industry standards; and,  \n  \n6\\. Should not require a deductible any greater than $500 US per accident or\nillness.  \n  \nThese minimum coverage requirements will be updated as necessary, per Section\nlIlA above.  \n  \nC. Campuses should monitor international student enrollment in a health\ninsurance plan that meets the minimum coverage requirements, as stated in\nSection IIIB above. They should monitor annually, at a minimum.  \n  \nD. International students who are not enrolled in a health insurance plan that\nmeets the minimum coverage requirements, as stipulated in Section IIIB above,\nwill be subject to university sanctions, including but not limited to\nregistration/transcript/diploma holds, until enrollment is complete.  \n  \nE. Students on J-1 visas must minimally abide by the federal regulations for\nmedical insurance coverage for J-1 visa holders. Therefore, students on J-1\nvisas are exempted from the areas and amounts of coverage listed in Part B\nabove.  \n  \nThis executive policy was applied in Fall 2010 for new students and no later\nthan Fall 2011 for continuing students.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo explain the process for recording accounting related journal entry\nadjustments in the University Kuali Financial System (KFS).  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nJournal Entry Electronic Document (eDoc) - An accounting document used to\nrecord financial transactions or adjustments in the KFS. Journal entries\nshould contain at least two accounting lines, and include explanations,\nreferences to and attachments of documentary evidence supporting the entries.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nThe KFS uses specialized eDocs to record journal entries. The different eDocs\nare designed to facilitate accurate recording of adjustments to general ledger\naccounts.  \n  \nA. Types of journal entry eDocs  \n  \n1\\. Distribution of Income and Expense (DI)  \n  \nThe DI document is used to distribute income or expense from a holding account\nto one or more appropriate accounts, when one account has incurred expenses or\nreceived income on behalf of one or more accounts. A DI can also be used to\nmove income, expenses, assets, and liabilities to other sub-accounts, object\ncodes, or sub-object codes.  \n  \na. In most cases, the distribution will involve the movement of amounts from\none account to another using the same object codes.  \n  \nb. The DI is also used to properly reclassify Amounts advanced to the Research\nCorporation of the University of Hawaii (RCUH) for service ordered projects  \nusing object code \u201c7232 \u2013 RCUH EXPENSE/ADVANCE\u201d to proper object code when\nspent.  \n  \n2\\. General Error Correction (GEC)  \n  \nThe GEC is used to correct accounting information that has been posted in the\nKFS.  \n  \na. Examples of common usage at UH are:  \n  \n1) Correcting accounts and object codes on a Financial Processing (FP) eDoc,\nor a PREQ (PO Invoice).  \n  \n2) Account correction for an expense (e.g., supplies were charged to an\nincorrect account).  \n  \nb. The GEC accounting line includes a reference field for the original entry\nbeing corrected. This information provides an audit trail to support the\ncorrection and augments documentation attached to the eDoc.  \n  \n3\\. Transfer of Funds (TF)  \n  \nThe TF is used to transfer funds (cash) between accounts. This document only\nallows the use of certain \u201ctransfer\u201d object codes. Transfers are neither\nrevenue nor expenditures but for accountability purposes, a \u201ctransfer-in\u201d\nbehaves like revenue while a \u201ctransfer out\u201d behaves like an expenditure. In\nKFS, these object codes have the following Object Sub-Type Codes:  \n  \na. TM (Transfers Mandatory) \u2013 Transfers required by external third parties or\ncontractual agreements because of:  \n  \n1) Agreements relating to the financing of educational and auxiliary plant, or\nprovisions for renewals and replacement of plant  \n  \n2) Legislation requiring appropriate financing of educational activities  \n  \n3) Legally binding endowment or other agreements  \n  \nb. TN (Transfers Non-mandatory) \u2013 Non-mandatory transfers are cash\ntransactions between accounts that are initiated at the discretion of a\ngoverning board or management. For commonly used non-mandatory transfer object\ncodes, see Attachment 1.  \n  \nThe from and to accounting lines for a particular transfer should have object\ncodes with the same object sub-type code (e.g. there should not be a transfer\nbetween a TM object code and a TN object code). Also, the object code to use\non an accounting line should describe the transfer destination account or\nsource account. On the FROM accounting line, the object code should describe\nthe account that the funds are being transferred to. Likewise on the TO\naccounting line, the object code should describe the account that the funds\ncame from.  \n  \n4\\. Internal Billing (IB)  \n  \nThe IB eDoc is used to bill for goods or services provided by one university\ndepartment to another university department, reflecting internal income to the\nprovider and expense to the customer. The IB eDoc should be prepared by the\ndepartment providing the goods or services since the document does not route\nto the responsible individual of the income accounting lines.  \n  \n5\\. Service Billing (SB)  \n  \nThe SB is used to record revenues and expenses between University accounts\nthat have a pre-approved written agreement. The SB records the same\ntransactions as the IB, but because of the pre-existing agreement, the SB eDoc\ndoes not route for approval and individuals need KFS authorization to be able\nto initiate SB eDocs.  \n  \n6\\. Salary Expense Transfer (ST)  \n  \nThe ST eDoc is used to move salaries and related benefit charges for a given\nemployee for a particular paid date or set of paid dates from one or more\naccounts to one or more accounts.  \n  \nAn employee may have multiple Employee IDs (Emp IDs), however, only one\nprimary Emp ID. The system only recognizes the primary Emp ID for salary and\nrelated benefits transfers. Data entry of the primary Emp ID will provide a\nlisting of the payroll expenses for the selected employee by Paid Date for all\nassociated Emp IDs. Security roles within the system, allow the ST initiator\nto view and move payroll expenses within their organization structure only.  \n  \nThe ST eDoc is used to correct an employee\u2019s payroll expense that was charged\nto an incorrect accounting string. This error could occur for a number of\nreasons, including:  \n  \na. Someone mis-keyed the payroll information, so the expense was initially\nposted to the wrong account.  \n  \nb. An employee was paid for work on a grant before the account was\nestablished, and the wages were initially posted into another account.  \n  \nc. The wages were initially paid on an expired or invalid account.  \n  \nd. An error was made when the employee was hired.  \n  \ne. A correction occurred in which the account was changed after an employee\nwas paid.  \n  \n7\\. Journal Voucher (JV)  \n  \nThe JV is used to record adjustments that cannot be effectively recorded by\nother journal entry eDocs. Access to the JV is restricted to central office\naccountants.  \n  \nB. Fiscal Administrator responsibilities for processing a journal entry eDoc  \n  \n1\\. All required fields (*) must be completed.  \n  \n2\\. Provide a detailed explanation for the adjustment in the explanation\nfield.  \n  \n3\\. Debit amounts must equal credit amounts.  \n  \n4\\. Attach supporting documentation in the notes and attachments tab.  \n  \n5\\. Additional reviewers can be added in the ad hoc recipients tab.  \n\n##  IV.

Definitions and uses of the mandatory student fees are provided below. These mandatory student fees shall be generally assessed of all students. Exceptions are described in Section III G of this policy for students in distance and on-line courses, who are not able to take direct advantage of certain co-curricular programs and opportunities at their course-offering campus. Chancellors may authorize exclusions for students in outreach and continuing education programs on their campuses or for students due to their geographic locations.\n  \n\n     * Student Activity & Program Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to foster a vibrant student life and to promote a unique and enriching student educational experience at UH campuses through a diversity of co-curricular student programs, activities, and services. On some campuses, where there is no distinct Student Government Fee, the Student Activity and Program Fees may support the cost of student government.\n  \n\n     * Student Publication Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to support and govern student publications such as the campus newspaper, literary magazines, e-publications, other print media, and related student advertising sales and promotions, affording students opportunities to write, edit, design, manage, do art, sell ads, conduct promotions, etc. that inform, educate and/or entertain the campus community.\n  \n\n     * Campus Center & Student Recreation Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to support student-governed, student-serviced, and student-administered facilities, programs, services, and activities that serve as the \u201cliving room, hearthstone, or community center\u201d for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests of the campus. Taken together, these facilities, programs, services, and activities offer conveniences and amenities that campus community members desire in their daily lives and create a focal point or gathering place where cultural, educational, social, recreational leisure, personal wellness, and physical fitness needs may be met.\n  \n\n       * These fees may also include those mandatory student activity fees used to support campus recreational facilities, programs, services, and activities that promote physical activity and wellness through student usage of indoor and outdoor recreational facilities and student participation in recreational opportunities such as intramural sports, fitness, outdoor adventures, aquatics, and other personal wellness or personal leisure activities. \n  \n\n       * Separate fees may be established to fund principal and interest payments of bonds sold as well as other debt obligations incurred for the construction, repair, renovation, and/or furnishing for facilities; as well as fund the operations of services and programs within campus center and/or student recreational facilities including personnel costs. \n  \n\n     * Student Government Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to encourage and foster student input, voice, and advocacy of the needs, interests, and concerns of students on campus through purposeful participation in institutional governance. These fees may also support the student government\u2019s sponsorship and funding of pertinent programs, services, and activities. Separate student government fees for undergraduates and graduates may be established given the composition of the campus student population.\n  \n\n     * Campus Communication Fees / Student Broadcast Fees include those mandatory student activity fees used to support and govern student broadcast such as campus radio station, television programs, film-making projects and other broadcast media, affording students opportunities to produce, engineer, and manage radio broadcasts as well as script write, edit, broadcast report, produce, and manage filmmaking that inform, educate and/or entertain the campus community.\n  \n\n     * Student Health Fees include those mandatory student fees used to provide a level of campus health services which contribute to students\u2019 physical, mental, and emotional well-being in order that they may persist towards their educational objectives.\n  \n\n     * Student Technology Fees include those mandatory student fees used to support computing and technology needs of students through timely repair, replacement, and/or renewal of equipment, infrastructure, and software in a rapidly changing environment and to maintain state-of-the-art technology to aid in academic achievement.\n  \n\n     * Student Transportation / UPASS Fees refer to those mandatory student fees used to support subsidized public transportation services negotiated with governmental entities operating such public transportation. These fees may also support other alternative transportation programs and services that promote sustainability through reduced consumption of fossil fuels among other approaches. \n  \n\n     * Student Athletic Fees refer to those mandatory student fees used to enhance the campus intercollegiate athletic program\u2019s revenue to assist with expenses such as scholarships, travel and subsistence, materials and supplies, and other expenses directly beneficial to student-athletes needed to offer a competitive intercollegiate athletic program given the campus\u2019 designated conferences of competition. These fees shall partially offset ticket costs for seats allocated to students to attend home events, promoting campus spirit and pride. A negotiated portion of these fees shall support a variety of activities for students, including those activities designed to enhance the student experience related to athletics as well as the student\u2019s athletic experience.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nThis policy shall apply to all campuses of the University of Hawai\u2018i.  \n  \n\n  1. Mandatory Student Fees Schedule shall reflect fee amounts approved by the Board of Regents. Approved fee amounts are made a part of the Fees Schedule codified as appendices located at the end of this policy.\n  \n\n  2. Assessment & Collection of Student Fees: As authorized by Board policies and University rules, each campus shall continue its practice of collecting mandatory student fees on behalf of its CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs. These student fees shall automatically be assessed to the student account when a student registers for any course on a campus. A student who registers for courses at more than one campus shall be assessed mandatory student fees of those campuses unless exempted as described in Part III G of this policy below. Fees may be based on the students\u2019 educational level, degree status, and enrollment status, among other factors. \n  \n\n  3. Changes to Student Fee Amounts: CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs may request that its student fee be increased or decreased, or that a new student fee be established. Such requests shall be submitted for Board approval with adequate justification via the appropriate campus chancellor and via the University president. Requests shall clearly explain why the change is necessary and how the change will be used to further the purposes and goals of the CSO, student activity program, or student program. As required by Regents Policy, RP6.203 III.B, operational and financial plans will accompany requests for new mandatory student fees. Requests shall outline appropriate consultative steps taken by the requesting body with constituents impacted by the fee change. Additionally, requests shall outline how this policy, particularly the Fee Schedule appendices will be amended. Should a multi-year student fee schedule be approved, ending rates for these fees shall remain in effect until the Student Fees Schedule is officially replaced by action of the Board or by delegated authority.\n  \n\n  4. Use and Expenditure of Mandatory Student Fees: CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs shall use and expend monies from the student activities revolving fund or other such student fee special or revolving fund for any purpose they deem necessary and proper to carry out and achieve their educational responsibilities, programs, and related activities, provided that the CSO, student activity program, or student program has met its own internal approval requirements and provided that any expenditure of funds is subject to the prior approval of the Board of Regents or its designated representative, the President or designee (HRS 304A-2257).   \nIn balancing the right of the CSOs, student activity programs, or student\nprograms to use and expend monies from its funds; the legal, fiduciary and\nadministrative responsibility of the Board for such monies; and the co-\ncurricular program objectives of affording students the opportunity to learn\nto exercise decision-making authority over such monies; all income and\nexpenditures shall be in compliance with applicable laws, rules, policies and\nprocedures of government and the University. As such, ultimate responsibility\nfor the proper financial management of the financial resources and other\nassets of CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs shall rest with\nthe University program head as defined by University policy.\n\n  \n\n  5. Appeals Process: When concerns arise regarding the expenditure of funds generated by student fees, students may appeal the decision of the University program head to every succeeding level of authority on the campus. This may include both decisions about the expenditure or non-expenditure of funds, such as when the program head does not approve the use and expenditure of monies from the student activities revolving funds or other such student fee special or revolving fund, after the CSO, student activity program, or student program has properly approved such expenditure. Each succeeding level of authority from the program head up through the Chancellor of the campus shall render a decision on the appeal within five (5) working days of receiving the appeal. The Chancellor of the campus or designee will render a final decision on the appeal within seven (7) working days of receiving the appeal.\n  \n\n  6. Annual Budgets and Financial Report: The CSO, student activity program, or student program shall submit an annual budget for University approval as required by Regents Policy, RP7.202 III.C. In the event that a CSO is inactive, full-time personnel in student life, student activities, or student affairs may submit an operating budget to cover operating costs, fixed and otherwise, for approval by the Chancellor of the campus via the campus senior student affairs officer. In addition, an annual financial report of actual income and expenditures by the CSOs, student activity programs, or student programs shall be submitted at such time and in such a manner as prescribed by University policy (Executive Policy EP 7.101).\n  \n\n  7. Distance & On-Line Learning Students; Concurrently Enrolled Students: The quality and excellence of the University of Hawaii rests on both the curricular (academic) and co-curricular (non-academic) programs that campuses offer. Just as tuition assessed by the campus is invested to enhance the educational experience for all its students through its library, labs, technology resources, and classroom facilities, so too are mandatory student fees assessed to enhance the out-of-classroom educational experience for all students through such co-curricular programs as theater, intramural sports, band, intercollegiate athletics, student newspaper, campus radio station, student government, student center, student clubs and organizations, etc. \n  \n\n     * The University values the transformative potential of educational experiences and opportunities offered by the co-curriculum that is available to students. The assessment of mandatory student fees is not dependent on whether a student actually uses specific fee-supported activities, programs, and services. Rather, the assessment of mandatory student fees enables the University to enrich the quality of campus life for its students, maintain its reputation and accreditation, and share the costs of the co-curriculum among all students.\n  \n\n     * All students who register for a course on any campus, including those in distance and on-line courses are recognized as members of the student body of the campus offering their courses. As such, all students, including those in distance and on-line courses, universally contribute to creating, increasing, and maintaining high quality, affordable co-curricular educational programs.\n  \n\n     * Students shall be required to pay mandatory student fees for student publications, student government, technology, and campus communication/student broadcast fees at all campuses at which they are enrolled, regardless of whether the course is taught online or at a distance. These fees support services that are accessible or provide direct benefits regardless of the student\u2019s geographical location. Students enrolled in classes on a campus will additionally be assessed the following campus-based mandatory student fees: student activity & program fees, campus center & student recreation res, student health fees, student transportation/UPASS fees, and student athletic fees.\n  \n\n     * Students in distance and on-line courses may be physically unable to take direct advantage of certain campus-based co-curricular programs and opportunities. Therefore, they shall be exempt from paying certain mandatory student fees of their course-offering campus. Students who enroll in purely distance or online courses at a particular campus shall not be assessed the following campus-based mandatory student fees: student activity & program fees, campus center & student recreation fees, student health fees, student transportation/UPASS fees, or student athletic fees.\n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nResponsibility for implementation of this policy shall rest with the\nchancellor of each campus.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nTo establish a definition, taxonomy, and broad guidelines for the development\nand issuance of micro-credentials.  \n  \nTo identify campus responsibilities in the creation of policies and practices\ndesigned to ensure academic standards and consistent practice in development\nand issuance of micro-credentials  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nDefinitions of all degrees and certificates offered by the University of\nHawai\u2018i System are provided in EP 5.205.  \n  \n\n  1. General Definitions:  \n\n    1. Credential: A credential is a general term that can be used to describe a degree, certificate, or other form of institutional-based acknowledgment.\n  \n\n    2. Micro-Credential: A micro-credential is a small unit of study that provides specific competencies that contribute to the needs of communities, industries, and students. Micro-credentials have stand-alone value and may satisfy components of other micro-credentials or credentials (certificates, minors, or degrees) through assessment or recognition of prior learning. Micro-credentials may be issued for credit, non-credit, or other recognized and assessed prior learning achievements. Those that bear credit are of a lesser scale than degrees, majors, minors, certificates, and concentrations. All micro-credentials include an assessment based on clearly defined standards and measurable learning outcomes. Micro-credentials awarded by the University of Hawai\u2018i meet the standards required by the issuing UH campus.\n  \n\n    3. UH Recognized Micro-Credential: UH recognized micro-credentials are those eligible for digital badging through the UH System and are managed within a coordinated framework. Recognized micro-credentials are validated learning achievements that support workforce development goals.\n  \n\n    4. Digital Badge: A digital badge is the digital representation of an achievement, including but not limited to an earned micro-credential. The relationship of a digital badge to a micro-credential is similar to the relationship of a diploma to an earned degree. Digital badges are verifiable through embedded meta-data and meet Open Badges standards, which ensures portability and legibility across various platforms that adhere to these standards.\n  \n\n  2. Hierarchy of Micro-Credentials  \n  \nAs micro-credentials are intended to recognize various levels of learner\nskills, the following hierarchy has been established:  \n\n    1. Awareness - Requires the learner to demonstrate foundational knowledge related to a skill set.\n  \n\n    2. Proficiency - Requires application and analysis of the target skill set.\n  \n\n    3. Mastery \u2013 Requires a demonstrated ability to evaluate or create based on accomplished level of ability.\n  \n  \n\n  3. Categories of Digital Badges  \n  \n\n    1. Participation - Not a micro-credential but can be badged.\n  \n\n    2. Skill - Badge issued for non-credit workforce training or professional development micro-credentials issued by UH.\n  \n\n    3. Association - Badge issued for achievement of a micro-credential related to a third-party learning experience (e.g., Prior Learning Assessment, industry-issued badge or micro-credential).\n  \n\n    4. Academic Achievement \u2013 Badge issued for a credit-bearing micro-credential.\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n  1. The authority to approve new instructional programs is detailed in RP 5.201, Instructional Programs, and EP 5.201, Approval of New Academic Programs and Review of Provisional Academic Programs, while the authority to award degrees and certificates is governed by EP 5.101, Authority to Award Degrees and Certificates for Programs Authorized by the Board of Regents. As micro-credentials are skill-based and may be awarded irrespective of course completion or the earning of credits, they are not classified as instructional programs under UH policy.\n  \n\n  2. Micro-credentials shall be developed by faculty, according to procedures established by each campus. It is the purview and responsibility of each campus to develop and implement procedures for the creation of new micro-credentials. Each campus shall be responsible for ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of its micro-credential offerings through appropriate processes of assessment and evaluation.\n  \n\n  3. Chancellors/Provost have the authority to approve the creation of micro-credentials and the issuance of digital badges and may delegate this authority to the chief academic officer or other designee at their campus, who is responsible for adhering to accreditation requirements.\n  \n\n  4. The Office of the Vice President for Information Technology, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy, provides system-level coordination of recognized micro-credentials offered across the UH campuses. Recognized micro-credentials are vetted to determine alignment with workforce development strategic initiatives, facilitate stackability of micro-credentials offered throughout the UH system, and coordinate systemwide data management. Recognized micro-credentials are eligible for digital badging, designed and issued through the UH System enterprise-level digital badging process.\n  \n\n  5. Micro-credentials may be embedded in existing courses within the curriculum. Micro-credentials issued for credit may be constructed in such a manner that will allow students to be eligible for federal financial aid. Academic departments may include micro-credentials as part of a degree program, allowing for the micro-credential to count within students' Course Program of Study (CPOS), thereby facilitating transfer between UH institutions. In such cases, campuses shall follow the terms of EP 6.204, Student Financial Assistance Program.\n  \n\n  6. It is expected that micro-credentials, as defined and covered under this policy, will not require significant resources. Any prospective micro-credentials requiring significant resources require approval of the Board of Regents, as specified in RP 5.201.\n  \n\n  7. As micro-credentials are linked to competencies and need not consist of sets of credit-bearing courses, they may provide campuses with opportunities to reach previously untapped markets of students. While each campus retains the purview to establish its own admissions policies and practices for micro-credentials, each campus must abide by the terms of RP 5.211, Admissions, which establishes parameters for the admission of students into academic programs.\n  \n\n  8. Micro-credentials may be stackable, which means that they can be accumulated over time in a structured sequence or pathway leading to a higher-order credential. Each campus shall determine criteria and processes for the incremental stacking of micro-credentials, including how they might lead to a credential.\n  \n\n  9. Each campus shall be responsible for recording student enrollment and achievement data for its micro-credential offerings in a central repository, as well as reporting out on those data points, as required by institutional accrediting bodies and/or UH leadership. Each campus shall be responsible for adhering to the U.S. Department of Education Financial Value Transparency and Gainful Employment Rule reporting requirements, as applicable.\n\n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policy establishing the mission and purpose of the university.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. Introduction  \n  \n1\\. The board believes that it is essential from time to time to re-examine\nthe mission and purpose of the university and to provide policy guidelines for\nits continued development and growth. The university has grown from a one-\ncampus operation to a multi-campus, statewide system requiring coordination\nand the establishment of priorities and policies reflecting such change. The\ncomments contained in this document, therefore, apply to the entire higher\neducation in the state. The benefits accruing to the state from this\narrangement are manifest when one compares the Hawai\u2018i system to the scattered\nand divided governance of higher education in most other states.  \n  \n2\\. The university has grown dramatically over the years. This growth has not\nonly been wholeheartedly supported by the people of Hawai\u2018i; it was, in a\nsense, mandated by them. The state\u2019s legislators and its elected and appointed\nofficers could not have brought about such sustained growth without the\nunderstanding, encouragement and backing of the citizens of Hawai\u2018i. The\ncommitment that the people of Hawai\u2018i have made to higher education is\nreflected in their financial support.  \n  \nB. An Environment of Change  \n  \n1\\. Since its founding, the university has undergone considerable change in\nsize, scope, and complexity. The university reflects the economic and social\nrealities of the state, which in turn, reflects the realities of the nation,\nand increasingly, the world. Both the state\u2019s capacity for funding the\nuniversity and the citizens\u2019 demand for services are responsive to this\nenvironment. Planning occurs within this broad context of change.  \n  \nC. Mission and Purpose  \n  \n1\\. The primary mission of the university is to provide environments in which\nfaculty, staff and students can discover, examine critically, preserve and\ntransmit the knowledge, wisdom, and values that will help ensure the survival\nof present and future generations with improvement in the quality of life.  \n  \n2\\. In carrying out that mission, it is the basic purpose of the university to\nafford all qualified people of Hawai\u2018i an equal opportunity for quality\ncollege and university education at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  \n  \n3\\. As the only provider of public higher education in Hawai\u2018i, the university\nembraces its unique responsibilities to the indigenous people of Hawai\u2018i and\nto Hawai\u2018i\u2019s indigenous language and culture. To fulfill this responsibility,\nthe university ensures active support for the participation of Native\nHawaiians at the university and support vigorous programs of study and support\nfor the Hawaiian language, history, and culture.  \n  \n4\\. Within its unique geographical location, the university will serve as a\nleader in how its stewards the resources of the islands and the world for the\nbenefit of all. The university shall be a global leader and model for the\nintegration of sustainability throughout its teaching, research, operations,\nand public service. The university recognizes than an important knowledge base\nin sustainable island systems resides in the indigenous people of Hawai\u2018i and\nall those for whom Hawai\u2018i is home. The university commits to consult with\nlocal cultural practitioners and sustainability experts on best practices in\nsustainable resource allocation and use for the well-being of our communities,\nour state, and the world. Critical resources include energy, food, water, land\nand sea as they are integrated with the relationships of family, culture,\ncommunity, justice, work, and economy in the present and future.  \n  \na. Basic unit missions  \n  \n1\\. University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa is a doctoral/research university with\nselective admissions. It offers baccalaureate, master\u2019s and doctoral degrees\nin an array of liberal arts and professional fields, degrees in law and\nmedicine and carries out organized research activities.  \n  \n2\\. University of Hawai\u2018i at Hilo is a comprehensive, primarily baccalaureate\ninstitution with a regional mission, offering baccalaureate degrees in the\nliberal arts, agriculture, nursing, and business, as well as select masters\nand doctoral degrees.  \n  \n3\\. University of Hawai\u2018i West O\u2018ahu is a four-year baccalaureate institution\nfounded in the liberal arts, serving professional, career-related, and applied\nfields, based on state and regional needs, and providing access through\npartnerships and distance delivery.  \n  \n4\\. The University of Hawai\u2018i Community Colleges are open-door, low-tuition\ninstitutions. Community colleges offer two-year college transfer and general\neducation programs, two and four-year career and technical education programs;\nsemiprofessional, career and technical, and continuing education programs, and\nsuch other educational programs and services appropriate to community\ncolleges.  \n  \nb. The board approves a mission statement that elaborates the basic system\nmission, articulating those qualities common to the system as a whole. At a\nminimum, the system mission incorporates the vision, purpose, and common\nvalues of the university system, emphasizing the fundamental commitment to\naccess and quality. The university system\u2019s special advantage and distinction\nin Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific affairs is highlighted in the mission, and the\noverall governance structure is summarized.  \n  \nc. The university is committed to diversity within and among all racial and\nethnic groups served by public higher education in Hawai\u2018i. The president,\nworking with the chancellors, ensures the unique commitment to Native\nHawaiians is fulfilled by:  \n  \n1\\. Providing positive system-wide executive support in the development,\nimplementation, and improvement of programs and services for Native Hawaiians;  \n  \n2\\. Encouraging the increased representation of Native Hawaiians at the\nuniversity;  \n  \n3\\. Supporting full participations of Native Hawaiians in all initiatives and\nprograms of the university;  \n  \n4\\. Actively soliciting consultation from the Native Hawaiian community and\nspecifically Puko\u2018a, the system-wide council of Native Hawaiian faculty, staff\nand students that serves as advisory to the president;  \n  \n5\\. Providing for and promoting the use of the Hawaiian language within the\nuniversity;  \n  \n6\\. Providing a level of support for the study of Hawaiian language, culture\nand history within the university that honors, perpetuates and strengthens\nthose disciplines into the future;  \n  \n7\\. Encouraging Native Hawaiians to practice their language, culture and other\naspects of their traditional customary rights throughout all university\ncampuses and providing Hawaiian environments and facilities for such\nactivities; and  \n  \n8\\. Addressing the education needs of Native Hawaiians, the State of Hawai\u2018i,\nand the world at large, in the areas of Hawaiian language, culture, and\nhistory through outreach.  \n  \nd. The university is committed to social, cultural, environmental, and\neconomic sustainability in operations; education, research and service;\nplanning, administration, and engagement; and cultural and community\nconnections. The president, working with the chancellors, ensures the\ncommitment to sustainability is fulfilled by:  \n  \n1\\. Establishing a Presidential Sustainability Policy that sets ambitious\nsustainability goals such that the university will achieve carbon neutrality,\nzero waste, and local food self-sufficiency;  \n  \n2\\. Providing system-wide executive support and coordination in the\ndevelopment, implementation, assessment, and improvement of programs and\nservices that encourage sustainability throughout the university and each of\nits campuses;  \n  \n3\\. Ensuring that the university meets or exceeds all statewide policies,\ntargets, and goals relevant to sustainability and coordinates with statewide\nsustainability initiatives;  \n  \n4\\. Establishing system-wide sustainability policies for operations;\neducation, research and service; planning and administration; engagement; and\ncultural and community connections;  \n  \n5\\. Establishing system-wide and, where appropriate, campus-specific metrics\nand targets for improved efficiency and reduced resource waste for buildings,\nclimate, dining, energy, grounds, purchasing, transportation, waste, and\nwater;  \n  \n6\\. Developing mechanisms to track and re-invest savings from sustainability\ninitiatives that further increase efficiencies, reduce waste, and improve\nsustainability; and;  \n  \n7\\. Reporting on accomplishments and challenges in implementing sustainable\npractices at the university.  \n  \ne. The president is delegated the authority to develop specific processes that\ncarry out the intent of this board policy. The president and his/her designee\nshall report to the board annually on progress in carrying out the\nuniversity\u2019s commitment to sustainability.  \n  \nf. The board also approves separate mission statements for the major units of\nthe system that use as their foundation the basic mission described herein and\nelaborates the separate and unique roles of these units within the system\u2019s\noverall mission. At a minimum, these unit mission statements define their\ndifferentiated missions in terms of instruction, research and service roles,\ncampus types, degree levels, populations served, student selectivity, and\nspecial campus distinctions.  \n  \ng. The president is responsible for adhering to the institution\u2019s mission\nincluding a thorough review of university and unit missions as needed, but at\nleast every ten (10) years. In conducting this review and recognizing the\nboard\u2019s final authority, to establish the mission of the university and its\nmajor units, the president ensures that each unit of the system has procedures\nthat include full participation in the review process with opportunity for\ncommunity input prior to submission to the board for adoption. All comments\nfrom the various sectors shall be summarized when transmitting the final\ndocument to the board.  \n\n##  IV.

Executive Policy\n\nThis Executive policy directs implementation of Board of Regents Policy, RP\n11.203, Naming of University Facilities, Properties and Programs.  \n  \n\n  1. The naming of University facilities, properties and programs shall be in accordance with Board of Regents Policy RP 11.203, the UH Foundation Gift Acceptance Policy, and this Executive policy.\n  \n\n  2. In accordance with their campus procedures, campus CEOs may recommend to the President names for University facilities, properties, and programs in keeping with the following guidelines. No commitment for naming shall be made prior to approval of the proposed name.\n  3.   \n  \n\n    1. A recommendation for a philanthropic naming may be submitted when the nominee makes a contribution or is named by a donor who makes a contribution that makes possible significant additions to the University facilities, properties or programs. Consideration for approval shall be given to the significance of the proposed gift as it relates to the success or realization of the purpose; the urgency of the need; the eminence of the individual whose name is proposed; and the individual\u2019s relationship to the University. Recommendations for philanthropic naming shall be submitted jointly by the UH Foundation and the relevant unit leader.\n  \n\n    2. As a general rule, honorific namings should be considered also in the context of philanthropic naming opportunities and are not recommended for individuals who are living or within five years of the person\u2019s death. A recommendation for an honorific naming may be submitted for an individual when:\n  \n\n      1. While serving the University in an academic capacity, the nominee demonstrated such high scholarly distinction as to have earned sustained national or international reputation in the individual\u2019s field(s) of specialization;\n  \n\n      2. While serving the University in an important administrative capacity, rendered distinguished sustained service to the University warranting recognition of the individual\u2019s exceptional contribution to the welfare of the University;\n  \n\n      3. Although not having served the University as an academic or administrator, the nominee contributed in truly exceptional ways over a sustained period to the welfare of the institution or achieved such unique distinction as to warrant recognition; and/or\n  \n\n      4. The nominee is of such outstanding character and distinction that naming a facility after him or her would honor the University of Hawai\u2018i as well as the individual. \n  \n\n      5. In cases where the individual to be honorifically recognized is living or it is within five years of the person\u2019s death, the President shall seek the advice of the Regents, who shall evaluate the nomination and provide the President their counsel regarding the nomination.\n  \n\n    3. Nominations to honorifically name University facilities, properties, and programs may be submitted to the President by any member of the University or external community. It shall be the responsibility of nominator(s) to provide sufficient background information to enable careful and thorough review of the nomination.\n  \n\n    4.

Purpose\n\nA. To provide University of Hawai\u2018i students with the opportunity to enroll at\nmember institutions in other areas of the United States through exchange\nplacements involving reduced tuition and fees.  \n  \nB. To operate the program on a partially self-supporting basis through the\ncollection of participant application/placement fees.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Introduction  \n  \n1\\. The National Student Exchange (NSE) is a consortium of colleges and\nuniversities which provides students an opportunity to exchange, for up to one\nacademic year, between member institutions in other areas of the United\nStates, its territories, and Canada. On July 27, 1978, the Board of Regents\napproved the University of Hawai\u2018i's participation in NSE, and delegated to\nthe President authority to set policy and administrative procedures for\nparticipation by respective Units.  \n  \n2\\. Membership by an institution in NSE is an agreement to reciprocate with\nother members in the admission of a limited number of exchange students, with\nprovision for special tuition arrangements. The NSE is viewed by the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i as essentially a student service and academic\nenhancement program partially supported by participant fees.  \n  \n3\\. Accordingly, the following objectives, policies, and procedures are\nestablished to govern participation in the NSE by Units and campuses of the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i.  \n  \nB. Process to Join Consortium  \n1\\. The President authorizes membership in the NSE consortium by individual\n4-year campuses of the University of Hawai\u2018i, approved by the Central Office\nof the National Student Exchange. UH-Manoa and UH-Hilo are currently\nauthorized to participate.  \n  \n2\\. Each campus participating in the NSE consortium must make provision to pay\nto the NSE consortium:  \n  \na. The annual campus institutional membership fee; and  \n  \nb. Such additional (application/placement) fees per participant as may be set\nby the NSE.  \n  \n3\\. The President approves a student application/placement fee for each\nCampus, under the authority delegated by the Board of Regents Policies, RP\n6.201 and RP 6.203. This fee is set to provide the per student payment (an\napplication/placement fee which is periodically increased) set by and due to\nthe NSE Central Office in addition to funds for certain additional campus\nprogram expenses (appropriate and necessary orientation activities and\neducational services provided by the campus to incoming exchange students).\nThe fee due to the NSE Central Office is non-refundable once a placement\ndecision has been made.  \n  \n4\\. In addition to the per-student application/placement fee due to the NSE\nCentral Office, revenues from the application/placement fee may be used to pay\nthe institutional membership fees, expenses for each campus NSE Coordinator to\nattend the mandatory NSE annual placement conference, and partial additional\ncampus program expenses.  \n  \n5\\. Under the authority delegated to the President by Regents Policies RP\n6.201 and RP 6.203, the President approves all changes in program fees for\neach campus.  \n  \n6\\. The maximum level of participation at each campus is to be determined by\neach Chancellor.  \n  \n7\\. Participation by non-resident students of the University of Hawai\u2018i in the\nNSE is permitted on a space-available basis, after demand for participation by\nresidents is fully satisfied.  \n  \n8\\. The Chancellor for each campus is responsible for overseeing the\nmanagement of the campus NSE program, in conformance with these policies and\nprocedures.  \n  \nC. Operational Guidelines  \n  \n1\\. Each campus maintains an account which is used to transact fiscal matters\npertaining to the University\u2019s participation in the NSE.  \n  \n2\\. Additional campuses of the University of Hawai\u2018i system may request\nauthorization from the President to participate in the NSE when there is\nsufficient student interest to suggest that partial self support can be\nachieved by maintaining a participant fee level that does not discourage\nparticipation.  \n  \n3\\. In keeping with the reciprocal nature of the program, each participating\nCampus will provide for reduced tuition and fees for incoming and outgoing NSE\nstudents in one of the two ways permitted by University and NSE policy:  \n  \na. Plan A, which permits the payment of resident (in-state/in-province)\ntuition and fees at the institution the student attends while on exchange.  \n  \nb. Plan B, which permits the payment of tuition and fees at the student\u2019s home\ninstitution, under the condition that incoming students accepted under this\nplan be granted tuition exemption.  \n\n##  IV.

Implements Board policy related to campus ceilings for nonresident\nundergraduate enrollments (nonresident enrollment caps) at the University of\nHawai\u2018i.  \n  \n2\\. Nonresident enrollment caps were first established in the 1970s as part of\nthe University\u2019s Controlled Growth Policy. In January 2011, the President was\ngranted the authority to establish campus ceilings for nonresident\nundergraduate enrollments in consultation with the Board (BOR Policy RP 5.211.  \n  \nB. Guidelines  \n  \n1\\. The nonresident enrollment cap is based on undergraduate enrollments only.\nGraduate and professional school enrollments are excluded from the\ncalculations. The exclusion is consistent with Board policy where graduate and\nprofessional programs have a special responsibility to admit the most\nqualified students while demonstrating that every effort is made to enroll\nresident applicants who compete favorably in the admissions process.  \n  \n2\\. Campus ceilings for nonresident undergraduate enrollment ceilings are 35\npercent at the baccalaureate campuses. Undergraduate enrollment ceilings at\nthe community colleges are 15 percent.  \n  \nC. Monitoring  \n  \nThe Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs shall monitor the\nnonresident undergraduate enrollment rates at the campuses each fall semester\nand work with them, as needed, to remain within their enrollment ceilings.  \n\n##  IV.

System Level Administrator \u2013 University level role typically associated\nwith a system level office such as GALC and ORS that is responsible for the\noverall compliance for their respective area of responsibility.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. KFS requires that an object code be provided as part of the accounting\nstring for all financial transactions for accounting and reporting purposes.  \n  \nB. Responsibilities  \n  \n1\\. FAs shall assign the appropriate object code with each financial\ntransaction.  \n  \n2\\. General Accounting and Loan Collection (GALC) shall develop and maintain\nthe object code table and obtain authorization for new codes from the State as\nrequired.  \n  \nC. Establishment of Sub-Object Codes and Object Codes  \n  \n1\\. A determination should be made whether a sub-object code linked to an\nexisting object code could be established to meet the classification needs of\nthe department. A sub-object code is an optional identifier to create finer\ndistinctions within a particular object code. For example, you have an object\ncode for laboratory supplies but you would like to track laboratory expenses\nat a greater level of detail, you could create sub-object codes to reflect\nlaboratory chemicals, laboratory instruments, lab ware, or any other\ndesignation necessary. Sub\u00ad object codes are specific to an account and fiscal\nyear and take on most of the attributes of the object code to which they\nreport. If a sub-object code will suffice, the requestor shall prepare the\nSub-Object Code Maintenance e-Doc in KFS.  \n  \n2\\. If it is determined that a new object code is needed, or if an existing\nobject code should be revised or inactivated, the requestor shall prepare the\nObject Code Maintenance Form, GALC-25 (Attachment 1) and forward the form to\nthe FA for review and approval.  \n  \n3\\. The FA shall approve and forward the GALC-25 to GALC for review and\napproval.  \n  \n4\\. GALC shall review the Object Code Maintenance Form for the business\njustification of the new, revision (edit) or inactivation (inactivate) object\ncode request. If the request is approved, GALC shall forward the form to the\nDisbursing Office for review. If the request is rejected, GALC shall complete\nthe reason for rejection and return the form to the FA.  \n  \n5\\. Each System Level Administrator shall review the request for the\nappropriate use of the object code within their respective area of\nresponsibility and functionality of the financial system module they are\naccountable for in addition to any reporting requirements, parameter, or\nmaintenance tables that may be affected. The System Level Administrator\nrepresentative shall complete their respective section of the form and if\napproved, forward the request to the next System Level Administrator listed on\nthe form. The last approving System Level Administrator shall forward the form\nto GALC for further processing. If the request is rejected, the System Level\nAdministrator shall complete the reason for rejection and forward the form to\nGALC for return to the FA.  \n  \n6\\. Upon final approval of the GALC- 25 by all System Level Administrators,\nGALC shall complete its section of the form and create or edit the object code\nby preparation of the Object Code Maintenance e-Doc in KFS. The completed\nGALC-25 form shall be added to the notes and attachments tab of the KFS e-Doc.  \n  \n7\\. The Campus Chart Manager shall review and approve or disapprove the e-Doc.  \n  \n8\\. The System Chart Manager shall review and approve or disapprove the e-Doc.  \n  \nNote: If the System Chart Manager initiates the e-Doc, only the Campus Chart\nManager would need to approve the e-Doc.  \n  \n9\\. Upon final approval of the e-Doc in KFS, GALC shall ad hoc route the e-Doc\nas an Acknowledgement to the requestor, Fiscal Administrator, and System Level\nAdministrators.  \n  \n10\\. The e-Doc can be ad hoc routed to other parties as necessary for review\nand approval.  \n  \nD. Object Code Attribute Table  \n  \nThere are many descriptive elements that the object code attributes cover.\nRefer to the Object Code Attribute Table (Attachment 2) for detailed\ndescriptions of each attribute for an object code.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policy on outside employment.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. Faculty and other personnel involved in outside employment as consultants\nshall make clear to all concerned that such consultation work is in no way\nconnected with or sponsored by the university.  \n  \nB. Outside employment for compensation shall be governed by the provisions\nspecified herein except as modified or superseded by a collective bargaining\nagreement.  \n  \n1\\. Members of the university faculty and staff are encouraged to promote the\ncultural and economic development of the state by utilizing their special\nabilities and skills in research, teaching, scholarly or artistic production,\nand consulting over and above the full requirements of the position to which\nthey are appointed. Such additional supplementary activity must in no way\ninterfere with the creditable performance of the primary obligation to the\nuniversity. Outside employment must be of a professional nature, and it should\ncontribute to the professional competence of the faculty member.  \n  \n2\\. Ethical considerations.  \n  \na. No teacher or teaching assistant of any grade or classification shall\naccept pay to tutor students in the subject matter of the courses they teach.  \n  \nb. The results of research conducted by the university shall be published or\notherwise made available to the public, and no researcher will sell the\nresults of research conducted by and for the university, unless authorized by\nthe president.  \n  \nc.

No faculty member shall accept off-campus positions or appointments,\nwhether paid or not, when such activities may impair their judgment of the\nfaculty member in the discharge of university duties.  \n  \nf. Although faculty members may not accept compensation for special\ninformation known to them by virtue of their employment with the university,\nthey may charge a fee or accept a retainer for the utilization of their\nspecial competence, knowledge and skill in consulting, design, or research\ndirected toward the solution of specific problems for a specific employer or\nclient.  \n  \n3\\. Compensation for university grant or contract research. Research is one of\nthe normal functions of a member of the faculty and grants, contracts, or\nuniversity-sponsored research funds may not be used to augment the total\nsalary of a faculty member except during summer months or during authorized\nleave periods. Extra compensation may be received for services performed\nduring summer months or authorized annual leave periods at a uniform rate\ndetermined by the percentage of effort of the faculty member, the member\u2019s\nannual salary, and the duration of the service. Faculty work schedules\nallowing for no vacation period will not be regularly permitted. Faculty\nmembers who claim extra compensation for summer months or annual leave periods\nmust file a Quarterly Effort Report with the director of research services.  \n  \n4\\. Compensation for teaching night classes or during summer sessions. Faculty\nmembers and staff may receive extra compensation to teach night classes or\nsummer session classes. The rate of compensation will be determined by the\nnumber of credit hours taught and the rank of the faculty member in accordance\nwith the schedule approved by the board. The total number of credit hours of\nevening and summer session teaching for which a faculty member may receive\ncompensation is limited to nine semester hours for those on academic year\nschedules, or five semester hours for those on calendar year schedules. These\ntotals may not be exceeded in any one year commencing with the beginning of\nthe fall semester. Non-credit courses will be counted on the basis of fifteen\nlecture hours for each credit hour. Generally, teaching load reductions for\nresearch will not be authorized during a semester in which a faculty member\nreceives extra compensation to teach evening classes, and extra compensation\nfor summer session instruction will not be allowed simultaneously with extra\ncompensation for summer research.  \n  \n5\\. Consulting, contract, and private employment. Faculty members may engage\nin consulting, contracting, or private employment under the general rules for\nnon-interference with university obligations and duties. Such activity should\nnot exceed the equivalent of one eight-hour work day per calendar week.  \n  \n6\\. Record of outside employment.

This replaces Administrative Procedure No. A9.880 dated February 2015.  \nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs  \nGoverning Board and/or Executive Policy:  \nReview Date: July 2025  \n\n##  I. Purpose\n\n  1. To promulgate policies and procedures governing the employment of students by the University of Hawai\u2018i to provide for a student classification and pay plan; and to establish the conditions of employment for students.\n  \n  \n\n  2. Applicability. The provisions of this directive apply to all campuses and affiliated agencies employing University of Hawai\u2018i students. Campuses may establish additional procedures on student employment provided that they are in conformance with the provisions of this procedure.\n\n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n  1. Student Assistants. Students who are employed by the University of Hawai\u2018i or affiliate agencies while pursuing a certificate, degree or professional diploma. This employment, regardless of funding source, is a form of financial assistance enabling the students to pursue their education. Student employment is intended to provide students with an opportunity to meet their educational objective, therefore, student assistants are not regular employees of the University and are not entitled to the same fringe benefits.\n  \n  \n\n  2. Campus Student Employment Office. That office of the campus which is responsible for the classification of student assistant positions, the finalizing of student assistant applications, and the placing of student assistants.  \n  \nIndividual campuses may make provisions to delegate these functions to other\ncampus offices as may be appropriate to meet special campus needs. This office\nis responsible for the enforcement of these policies and is authorized to\ninitiate necessary payroll transactions when violations persist (e.g.\nmandatory increments, termination upon graduation, incomplete I-9, etc.).\n\n  \n  \n\n  3. Educational Affiliation Amongst UH Campuses. Current federal regulations provide for international students to be employed up to 20 hours per week during the academic year and up to full time during the student's annual summer term. On-campus employment at an off-campus location is allowed, if there is an educational affiliation between a student's home campus and another campus or organization.  \n  \nThe University of Hawai\u2018i acknowledges that there exists a continuous and on-\ngoing educational affiliation amongst the UH campuses based on educational\ncurriculum, the UH strategic plan, and these policies which facilitate UH\nstudent employment at all UH campuses.  \n  \nAny UH-enrolled international student may be employed on any UH campus without\nneeding prior authorization from the international student services unit at\nthe student's home school provided the student meets all other eligibility\ncriteria set forth in these policies and as established on the campus where\nthe student seeks employment.\n\n  \n  \n\n  4. Earning Modules. That dollar portion, as determined by the campus financial aid office, of the student's financial aid package expected to be achieved through employment.  \n  \nNOTE: Financial aid policies and procedures govern all aspects of earning\nmodules for Federal Work Study students.\n\n  \n\n##  III.

Although a formal signed agreement is not required to be submitted to the campus student employment office, the following is highly recommended:  \n\n      1. A memorandum of the agreement shall be kept in the employing unit, with notations of the effective date, reason for, and the length of time the agreement is in effect, and  \n\n      2.

The\ncampus should also identify needed locations for wellness/lactation rooms\naccessible to students and employees.  \n  \nThe campus should assign a position or unit to monitor and promote\nimplementation of this policy, and outline priorities for implementation in a\ntransition plan.  \n  \nB. Gender-Inclusive Facilities Conversion or Construction Guidelines.  \n  \n1\\. Existing Buildings.  \n  \nWhere feasible, all single-occupancy gender-specific restrooms in existing\nbuildings should be converted to single-occupancy gender-inclusive restrooms.\nAs budgets allow, existing buildings that have locker rooms or showers should\nbe modified to have at least one gender-inclusive locker room or shower. If\nfunding is limited, existing gender-specific facilities should be adapted, for\nexample, by adding privacy options such as shower curtains or doors.  \n  \n2\\. Existing restrooms, showers, locker rooms, and changing facilities.  \n  \na. The University will identify and designate existing single-occupancy\nrestrooms as gender-inclusive or \u201call gender,\u201d to the extent feasible. This\nwill provide safe, comfortable options for persons regardless of their gender\nidentity. This will also accommodate parents and caregivers who are a\ndifferent gender from their children, as well as attendants and personal aides\nwho are a different gender.  \n  \nb. With regard to existing gender-specific lockers, showers, and changing\nfacilities, appropriate accommodations will be made to the extent feasible.  \n  \nc. With regard to wellness/lactation rooms, each campus should identify at\nleast one appropriate space that is private and comfortable, other than a\nrestroom.  \n  \n3\\. New Building Construction or Major Building Renovation.  \n  \na. The University is also committed to increasing gender-inclusive and\naccessible options, including creating more single-occupancy gender-inclusive\nrestrooms, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible restrooms and\nfamily restrooms, and gender-inclusive showers, locker rooms and changing\nfacilities.  \n  \nb. These facilities should be inclusively designed as feasible to be usable by\nand accessible to as many people as reasonably possible. Availability of\ninclusive facilities is optimal from the perspective of ADA universal design\nfor persons who may need to be accompanied by personal attendants, and parents\nand caregivers with children of a different gender, as well as to provide safe\nand comfortable options for persons regardless of their gender identity.  \n  \nc. For each new building being constructed or each building undergoing major\nrenovation, the scope of work should include at least one gender-inclusive\nrestroom. Where feasible, the gender-inclusive restrooms should be located in\nclose proximity to the gender-specific restrooms. If allowed by codes, the\nscope of work may incorporate multi-stall gender-inclusive restrooms in high\ntraffic areas or buildings with high occupancy loads.  \n  \nd. If the building being constructed or renovated has or is anticipated to\nhave locker rooms or showers, then to the extent feasible, the building should\nhave at least one gender-inclusive locker room or shower in close proximity to\nthe gender-specific locker room or shower.  \n  \ne. If it is reasonable to expect that a building being constructed or\nrenovated will be patronized regularly by families, then the gender-inclusive\nrestroom, where feasible, should be equipped with a baby changing table and\nsized with sufficient space to accommodate a caregiver and baby gear. Where\nfeasible and as needed, the building being constructed or renovated should\nalso have at least one wellness/lactation room in an accessible location. This\nshould be a private locked room or other private space (not in a restroom)\npreferably with electrical outlets and in close proximity to a sink.  \n  \nC. Other considerations.  \n  \n1\\. All design, new construction, renovation, or conversion of gender-\ninclusive facilities should comply with the applicable federal and state laws,\nand building codes.  \n  \n2\\. The UH Commission on LGBTQ+ Equality or LGBTQ+ Center Directors should be\nconsulted regarding preferred floor location for single-occupancy gender-\ninclusive restrooms, since the first floor may not be ideal for single-\noccupancy gender-inclusive restrooms.  \n  \n3\\. The signage for gender-inclusive restrooms should state \u201cRESTROOM\u201d or \u201cALL\nGENDER RESTROOM,\u201d with no other gender-specific designation. If the restroom\nis new or has been renovated, the sign should also include the ADA pictogram\nand be ADA and building code compliant.  \n  \n4\\. Single-use facilities should ideally have door hardware that displays the\nword \u201coccupied\u201d when in use.  \n  \n5\\. If gender-inclusive restrooms include multi-stall facilities, these should\nbe designed to ensure optimum privacy, such as ensuring secured locks on\nrestroom or stall doors. Other measures may include: installing flaps on the\nouter edge of stall doors to cover gap between the door and the stall wall and\nextending stall partitions to increase privacy (but not necessarily floor-to-\nceiling).  \n  \n6\\. Location of all of these inclusive facilities should be posted on the\nrespective campus websites for quick access and location.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nThis Executive Policy implements the authority conferred upon the University\nof Hawai\u2018i by Act 38, Session Laws of Hawai\u2018i, 2017, to establish a regulatory\nframework and compliance program to ensure that technology transfer activities\nsponsored by the University comply with specific ethical principles in the\nState Ethics Code.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n\u201cState Ethics Code\u201d is Chapter 84, Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes.  \n  \n\u201cAct 38\u201d refers to Act 38, Session Laws of Hawai\u2018i, (2017) effective on June\n19, 2017. Act 38 facilitates the University\u2019s contribution to research\ncommercialization and economic development in the State by exempting\nUniversity-sponsored technology transfer activities from specific sections of\nthe State Ethic Code provided that the technology transfer activities comply\nwith a policy framework and compliance program established by the University.  \n  \n\u201cAct 39\u201d refers to Act 39, Session Laws of Hawai\u2018i (2017) effective on July 1,\n2017. Act 39 provides express statutory authority to allow the University to\nuse its public resources to commercialize inventions or discoveries generated\nby or at the University.  \n  \n\u201cTechnology Transfer\u201d is the process by which new discoveries and inventions\ncreated by University personnel are selected, developed, and transferred\nthrough various business arrangements to the larger economy as potentially\nviable commercial products or services.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nMany parties contribute to the transfer of new technologies invented or\ndiscovered at the University to the larger society. These parties include the\nfollowing: (a) the individual University inventor(s); (b) the external\nresearch sponsors, including federal agencies, that provide external funds and\nother support for the inventor\u2019s research activities; (c) the University that\nprovides facilities, equipment, professional and technical support personnel,\nand administrative infrastructure to manage the development and transfer\nprocess; and (d) the private entrepreneurs, private investors, and the\ncommercial business enterprises that invest in, license, develop, and\ntransform the discovery into economically viable commercial products or\nservices.  \n  \nIn the early stages of invention and discovery, the University as the\nsupporting institution and the individual inventors shoulder, comparatively,\nmuch more of the burdens and risks than during the later stages of technology\ntransfer. During the early stages, both the University and the individual\ninventor often perform multiple functions, must satisfy conflicting fiduciary\nduties, and must balance competing time commitments. As the inventions are\ndeveloped and refined, and as the potential for commercial viability becomes\nmore evident, private investors and entrepreneurs may seek greater\nparticipation and may assume more of the risks and economic rewards to drive\nthe transfer process forward. During the later stages when the invention is\ndeveloped into a mature, viable commercial product, the role of the University\nmay be limited to a passive, minority participant in the economic venture as\nopposed to an active sponsor. The responsibilities of the inventor, too, may\nbe narrowed as roles are differentiated and as the commercializing entity\nbuilds a private workforce to perform the tasks of manufacturing, marketing,\nfinancing and internal management or administration.  \n  \nBecause of the mix of public and private resources and personnel participating\nin the technology transfer process, and because of their unique goals and\nobjectives which may evolve over the life cycle of the product, ethical\nconflicts of interest may arise during the course of technology transfer. For\nthe purposes of this policy, ethical conflicts of interest can be grouped into\nthree types: conflicts of purpose; conflicts of loyalty; conflicts of\ncommitments.  \n  \nConflicts of purpose arise when public resources placed at the disposal of the\nUniversity are used to support or promoted commercial activities that may\ngenerate significant profit or benefit for private individuals or private\norganizations. Conflicts of loyalty arise where a University decision maker\nhas multiple fiduciary duties that may conflict with each other and may bias\nthe decision. Conflicts of commitment, as used in this policy, arise when a\nUniversity employee must allocate and balance limited time and attention among\nmultiple activities and institutional obligations.  \n  \nA. General Policy  \n  \nUniversity resources may be used to support and promote the commercialization\nof University-generated technology, even where there may be economic returns\nto private entities participating in the technology transfer process, so long\nas the public interests and benefits are adequately identified and protected,\nthe core missions of the University are not adversely affected, the various\nconflicts of loyalty and commitments are disclosed, mitigated, and managed,\nand the allocation of anticipated newly-created economic value among the\nvarious participating interests is reasonable and commensurate with the risks\nundertaken and contributions made by each participant.  \n  \nThe identification, mitigation, and management of the various conflicts of\ninterests for a specific technology transfer shall be set forth in a conflict\nof interest management plan. Because these interests may change over the life\ncycle of the transfer process, conflict of interest management plans must be\nperiodically reviewed to adapt to changing circumstances.  \n  \nWith respect to conflicts of purpose, in deciding whether to sponsor\ntechnology transfer activities, the University must identify the public\nbenefits to be gained and there must be a general alignment of the sponsorship\nof technology transfer actives with the mission of the University.  \n  \nIn conducting these technology transfer activities, the University must avoid,\nmitigate, or manage conflicts of loyalty or conflicts of commitments. This\nmitigation of conflicts may include divestiture of financial interests, or\nrecusal from decision making, or formal reallocation of work load or time\ncommitments. If conflicts are unavoidable, the conflicts should be managed,\nincluding full disclosure of the nature and extent of the conflict to other\nparties to the transaction.  \n  \nThe proposed economic arrangements must be reviewed by disinterested\nUniversity officers, ethical screens must be established, and confidential\ninformation sequestered. If the conflicts cannot be avoided or satisfactorily\nmanaged, a waiver of the ethic requirements otherwise applicable may be\ngranted, but only where necessary to allow the activity to occur and only if\nthe waiver is narrowly tailored, and limited in scope and duration.  \n  \nB. Policy Guidance for Specific Areas  \n  \nThe State Ethics Code sets forth general ethical principles that apply\nthroughout the state and across a wide range of activities. Under Act 38, six\nspecific sections of the State Ethics Code do not apply to technology transfer\nactivities sponsored by the University, so long as those activities comply\nwith a compliance framework and policy established and administered by the\nUniversity in these six areas of concern.  \n  \nThe following sections provide specific University policy guidance for these\nsix (6) areas of concern:  \n  \n1\\. Use of Confidential Information. [State Ethics Code, Section 84-12]  \n  \nIn general, proprietary or confidential information about University\ndiscoveries or inventions and any potential business arrangements for the\ncommercialization of such inventions may be protected from public disclosure\nas permitted under applicable exceptions to the State\u2019s Open Records law or\nthe Open Meetings law. In addition, specific disclosure and exchange of\nconfidential information between the University and private parties may be\nallowed to facilitate business negotiations and promote commercialization of\nUniversity-affiliated discoveries or inventions. The University may develop\nand use industry-standard forms for Non-Disclosure Agreements or similar\nconfidentiality agreements to establish the procedures, conditions, and\nsafeguard to exchange and disclose confidential information for prospective\ncommercialization arrangements.  \n  \n2\\. Fair Treatment and Use of Public resources. [State Ethics Code, Section\n84-13]  \n  \nThe University may use its public resources, such as its laboratory facilities\nand equipment and its administrative infrastructure to produce commercial\nproducts or services that, as a necessary consequence, may generate economic\nbenefits to private organizations or individuals. This use of public resources\nis permissible so long as there is a clear identification of potential public\nbenefits created by these commercial products and services, and if the\nproposed activity is consistent with the mission and purpose of the University\nand its programs. In addition, any business arrangements for the use of\nUniversity resources should reflect standard business terms and conditions,\nshould be negotiated at arm\u2019s length, and must be  \napproved by University decision makers who do not have conflicts of loyalty\nfor the particular transaction.  \n  \n3\\. Conflicts of Interests. [State Ethics Code, Section 84-14]  \n  \nIn the context of University-sponsored technology transfer, conflicts of\ninterest arise for the individual faculty or research staff who contribute\ndirectly to the invention or discover of the technology as a University\nemployee and who may simultaneously have an economic interest in a private\nentity that participates in the technology transfer.  \n  \nRemunerative arrangements between a University employee and a private entity\nthat is commercializing a University invention or discovery must be timely\ndisclosed to the University. These economic interests may include employment\ncontracts, consulting arrangements with the private entity, or equity\nownership, loans, or other forms of financial participation.  \n  \nA conflict of interest management plan must be developed and approved to\nhandle these remunerative arrangements. The management plan may require\ndivestiture or avoidance of the conflicts under appropriate circumstances. If\ndivestiture is not feasible, the University may establish ethical screens\namong the parties, and may require recusal of the interested party from\nparticipating in discussions or negotiations of the business arrangements.  \n  \nIndividualized conflict of interest management plan for specific particular\ntechnology transfer commercialization project shall be established and\napproved pursuant to appropriate University Administrative Procedures.  \n  \nDecision-makers with oversight responsibility and authority over any aspect of\nthe technology transfer must be free of conflicts, including financial\ninterests. Ethical screens should be established, limited authority may be re-\ndelegated to avoid fiduciary conflicts of interest, and recusals may be\nrequired where appropriate.  \n  \nConflicts of time commitments must be identified and resolved in compliance\nwith any applicable collective bargaining agreement provision, rule or\nregulation, including, assurances, where applicable, that the cumulative\ncommitment of an individual\u2019s time comports with the requirements of the\nresearch sponsor and the University\u2019s human resources policies.  \n  \n4\\. Contracts with Employee-controlled Entities. [State Ethics Code, Section\n84-15]  \n  \nIn certain technology transfer circumstance the University employee primarily\nresponsible for inventing the technology may seek permission to hold a\ncontrolling ownership interest in an entity that is specifically created to\ncommercialize the technology. For example, the inventor may sometimes seek\npermission to be retained as the \u201cchief scientific officer\u201d in a commercial\nbusiness, or may be asked to identify and develop business markets for the\nproduct, or may be retained to explain the technology and market the product.\nThese employee-controlled business entities may often seek to have a\ncontinuing economic arrangement with the University, such as licensing a\nUniversity patent, sponsoring further research by the University, or\npermitting the University to have an ownership interest.  \n  \nThe University may enter such proposed business arrangements with a private\ncompany, notwithstanding the responsibilities held by the University employee\nin the private company, so long as the business terms of the contract are\nnegotiated at arm\u2019s length by disinterested University administrators, are\nwithin the range of terms customarily considered by the relevant industry to\nbe fair and reasonable, and are part of an approved conflict of interest\nmanagement plan.  \n  \n5\\. Retroactively Voiding Contracts. [State Ethics Code, Section 84-16]  \n  \nThe University may fashion appropriate remedies, including but not limited to\nvoiding technology transfer and IP commercialization contracts, may enter into\nother settlements, or may fashion remedial measures, to address ethical\nviolations. The authority to address and resolve violation of the University\npolicies with respect to technology transfer shall reside with the President,\nor the President\u2019s designee.  \n  \n6\\. Restrictions on Post-Employment. [State Ethics Code, Section 84-18]  \n  \nUniversity employees who participate actively in inventing or developing the\ntechnology may often have employment opportunities with the private entity to\nfurther develop the technology, or help commercialize the product to market,\nor represent the entity in further dealings with the University. Such post-\nemployment opportunities may be allowed, if the public and the University\u2019s\ninterests are adequately protected, notwithstanding any time-bar restrictions\nfor post-employment activities under the State Ethics Code.  \n  \nC. Relationship of this Executive Policy to Other Legal and Contractual\nRequirements.  \n  \nNotwithstanding this policy, technology transfer activities conducted at the\nUniversity must comply with specific, applicable federal regulations and with\nrequirements of the State Ethics Code that are otherwise applicable.\nActivities must also follow specific terms and conditions imposed by the\nresearch sponsor, such as the reservation of a non-exclusive license to any\nintellectual property developed as a result of the sponsored research. In\ncases where other legal or contractual obligations exist, such as requirements\nin applicable collective bargaining agreements, this executive policy is\nintended to supplement but not supplant these other legal or contractual\nrequirements.  \n  \n1\\. Federal Regulation.  \n  \nIf certain limitations or restrictions on responsibilities and authority\nregarding conflicts of interest are prescribed by applicable federal laws or\nregulations, those federal laws or regulations, take precedence over any\nguidance set forth in this policy. These superseding federal regulations\ninclude, for example, regulations for Small Business Innovation Research\n(\u201cSBIR\u201d), or Small Business Technology Transfer (\u201cSTTR\u201d), or federal\nregulations regarding Research Misconduct, and Financial Conflict of Interest.  \n  \n2\\. Applicable Provisions of the State Ethics Code.  \n  \nAct 38, Session Laws of Hawai\u2018i, (2017) exempted University-sponsored\ntechnology transfer activities from six enumerated sections of the State\nEthics Code [Sections 84-12, 84-13, 84-14, 84-15, 84-16, and 84-18]. Under Act\n38, the State Ethics Commission retains jurisdiction to administer other\nsections of the State Ethics Code, such as for example gift disclosure and\nrestrictions under Section 84-11, for University technology transfer\nactivities, and retains jurisdiction to administer all sections of the State\nEthics Code for other University activities not related to technology transfer\nactivities.  \n  \n3\\. Other University Executive Policies.  \n  \nThe University has policies and procedures governing outside employment\ninterests or conflict of interest. See, for example, EP 12.214. To the extent\npossible, these policies must be followed in technology transfer activities.  \n  \n4\\. Collective Bargaining Agreements.  \n  \nNothing in this executive policy shall be interpreted to deprive, impair, or\ndiminish any existing collectively bargained benefit proved to an employee at\nthe University, nor shall this executive policy supersede the rights of the\nemployees\u2019 exclusive bargaining representative.  \n  \nWhen University technology is patented and licensed to a third party, the\nUniversity and the inventors may share in any economic return generated by the\nlicense, such as fees or royalties. The University may not enter into or\nperform any third party agreement that materially alters or contradicts\nprivileges, rights, and benefits conferred upon the exclusive bargaining\nrepresentative and/or any member of a public employee union at the University\nby a collectively bargained agreement.  \n  \nConfidentiality of commercial proprietary information shall be observed,\nprovided, however, that information relating to a participating faculty\nmember\u2019s technology transfer activities may be disclosed to the extent\nnecessary to evaluate the participating faculty member\u2019s application for\ntenure or promotion under applicable collective bargaining agreements.  \n  \nA faculty member\u2019s participation in University-approved technology transfer\nactivities may materially affect the workload, outside compensation, teaching\nassignments, professional responsibilities, tenure and promotion, patent and\ncopyright and other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The\ndevelopment of appropriate equivalents in accordance with R.P. 9.214 and\napplicable collective bargaining agreement provisions shall give due\nconsideration to the nature and extent of faculty member\u2019s involvement in\nUniversity-approved technology transfer activities and commercialization of\nintellectual property.  \n  \nAny employee affected by a decision to void, rescind, or modify any technology\ntransfer commercialization arrangement to which that employee is a party,\nshall be given a copy of the decision. A copy of the decision shall also be\nprovided to the employee\u2019s collective bargaining representative, if\napplicable.  \n  \nD. Procedures to Resolve Conflicts of Loyalty, Conflicts of Commitments, and\nConflicts in the Private Use of Public Resources.  \n  \nAllegations of potential conflict of loyalty, conflict of commitment, or\nconflict in use of University resources for technology transfer activities\nshall be brought to the attention of the Vice President for Research and\nInnovation. The Vice President may adopt and implement reasonable procedures\nto address and resolve ethical conflicts of interest arising out of\nUniversity-sponsored technology transfer activities. The Vice President may,\non the Vice President\u2019s own volition, initiate a review of any proposed\ntechnology transfer activity implicating University intellectual property and\nUniversity resources and creating conflicts of interests.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation (OVPRI) is\ndelegated the authority to administer these policies and issue administrative\nprocedures. The Vice President for Research and Innovation may further\ndelegate the authority to units or offices within OVPRI.  \n\n##  V.

All relationships between University employees\nand its students adhere to principles of professionalism, integrity, mutual\ntrust, and respect. Any relationship that calls these principles into question\njeopardizes the University\u2019s ability to effectively carry out its mission and\nmaintain public trust.  \n  \nWithin an academic environment, the issue of consensual relations within the\nworking and/or learning environment deserves special attention. When such a\nrelationship involves individuals with a power and/or control differential, it\nis of special concern because of the potential for conflict of interest,\nappearance of such conflicts, and/or abuse of power. All education and\nemployment decisions shall be made free from bias or favoritism. Certain\ndecisions may come into question when made by a person who has a romantic,\ndating, or sexual relationship with a person who may benefit from or be harmed\nby the decisions. The mere appearance of bias or impropriety resulting from a\nconsensual romantic, dating, or sexual relationship may seriously disrupt the\nlearning or working environment. Equally important, such relationships have\nthe potential to undermine the University\u2019s sense of community, mutual trust,\nand support.  \n  \nTherefore, the University prohibits initiating or engaging in a new consensual\nrelationship between employees and between employees and students wherein a\npower and control differential exists, including but not limited to situations\nin which one member has an evaluative and/or supervisory responsibility for\nthe other. The University views these consensual relationships where a power\nand/or control differential exists as inadvisable and fraught with risk,\nespecially when students are involved. It is important to note that the\npotential for sexual harassment exists in consensual relationships when there\nis a power and/or control differential.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. Consensual Relationship  \n  \nThe term \u201cconsensual relationship\u201d is defined as a relationship in which two\nindividuals are engaged by mutual consent in a romantic, dating, or sexual\nrelationship.  \n  \nB. Employee  \n  \nThe term \u201cemployee\u201d is defined as all individuals classified as\nadministrators, faculty, staff, temporary hires, casual hires, and student\nstaff, employed by the University. Staff includes, but is not limited to,\ninstructors, graduate/teaching assistants, graders, athletic coaches, and\nresidence hall staff.  \n  \nC. Power and/or control differential  \n  \nThe term \u201cpower and/or control differential\u201d is used to describe the situation\nthat results when one individual in a relationship has direct supervision,\ndirection, instruction, oversight, evaluation, advisement, or substantial\ninfluence over the employment or educational status of another.  \n  \nD. Retaliation  \n  \nRetaliation is defined as adverse actions taken against a person because of\ntheir participation in the following types of protected activities:  \n  \n1\\. Seeking advice or assistance about this consensual relationship policy;  \n  \n2\\. Reporting or filing an informal or formal complaint regarding an alleged\nviolation of this policy;  \n  \n3\\. Testifying, assisting, or participating in an investigation or other\nproceeding related to an alleged violation of this policy.  \n  \nAdverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from\nmaking or supporting a complaint of violation of this policy.  \n  \nExamples of adverse actions that might constitute retaliation include a\nsignificant change in one\u2019s status, such as suspension, unsatisfactory or\nunfair evaluations, unfair grades, unfair assignments, firing, failing to\npromote, reassignment with significantly different responsibility or a\ndecision causing a significant change in benefits, direct or implied threats,\ncoercion, harassment, intimidation, or encouragement of others to retaliate.  \n  \nE.

Executive Policy\n\nA. Statement on Consensual Relationships  \n  \nIt is a violation of this policy for an employee to initiate or engage in a\nromantic, dating, or sexual relationship with another employee or a student\nwhom he/she currently supervises, directs, instructs, evaluates, advises, or\nhas substantial influence over wherein a power and control differential\nexists.  \n  \n  \nCertain employees of the University who are licensed professionals must adhere\nto the rules of professional responsibility and ethics in their field\naddressing consensual relationships (e.g., student health service providers,\nschool psychologist or licensed counselors).  \n  \nViolations of this policy include, but are not limited to:  \n  \n1\\. Entering into a consensual relationship where a power and/or control\ndifferential currently exists  \n  \n2\\. Not disclosing the existence of a consensual relationship when a new\nUniversity-related relationship is established that involves a power and/or\ncontrol differential and potential conflict of interest  \n  \n3\\. Not adhering to an established a plan to manage and/or resolve the\nconflict of interest  \n  \nThe University has the obligation to manage the potential conflicts of\ninterest created by consensual relationships where a power and/or control\ndifferential between individuals exists to ensure the integrity of the working\nand learning environments in the University. Steps that may be taken to manage\nsuch conflicts of interest are listed in part III.C. below.  \n  \nB. Proposed Consequences  \n  \nSanctions may be imposed against any employee who is found to have violated\nthis policy. Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to, suspension or\ntermination from employment for excluded employees, and disciplinary actions\npursuant to collective bargaining agreement provisions for included employees.  \n  \nC. Circumstances for Disclosure and Conflict of Interest Management of\nConsensual Relationships  \n  \nThe University also recognizes that a consensual relationship may exist prior\nto the passage of this policy or prior to the time an individual is assigned\nto a direct supervisory, instructive, or evaluative position or\nresponsibility. In this situation, all employees who are in a consensual\nrelationship have an obligation to disclose the existence of that relationship\nand cooperate with managing potential conflicts of interest, as follows:  \n  \nConsensual relationships of the following nature shall require disclosure and\nthe development and adherence to a plan to manage the potential conflicts of\ninterest as described in this policy:  \n  \n1\\. Employee with any student that is currently under their supervision,\ndirection, instruction, oversight, evaluation, advisement and/or that is under\ntheir substantial influence as to his/her employment or educational status; or  \n  \n2\\. Employee with a direct-line supervisor (e.g., vice president, dean,\ndirector, department chair) or any other employee in a position of authority\nto hire, supervise, or influence the employment or salary of another employee.  \n  \nShould an individual who is involved in a consensual relationship where no\npower and/or control differential exists, subsequently be placed in a\nrelationship where a power and/or control differential results, the existence\nof the consensual relationship must be disclosed to the individual\u2019s immediate\nsupervisor (i.e., chair, director, dean, vice chancellor, chancellor, etc.)\nor, if necessary, the next higher level supervisor not involved in the\nrelationship. Impermissible relationships between a graduate/teaching\nassistant and a student should be reported by the faculty member that\nadvises/oversees the student to that faculty member\u2019s immediate supervisor.  \n  \nThe immediate supervisor referred to above is responsible for advising the\nindividuals and determining the appropriate method to manage and/or resolve\nthe conflict of interest that may exist due to this relationship. The\nimmediate supervisor may choose to confer with their campus Human Resources\noffices, Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EEO/AA)\nCoordinators, and/or Title IX Coordinators to assist in determining the\nappropriate conflict resolution for the reported relationship.  \n  \nMethods to manage and/or resolve the actual conflict of interest created by a\nconsensual relationship may include, but are not limited to:  \n  \n1\\. Recusal or removal of an employee from the evaluative process (i.e.,\ncontract renewal) concerning the other individual  \n  \n2\\. Assignment of an additional, impartial individual or individuals to ensure\nthe integrity of the actions of the individuals involved in the relationship  \n  \n3\\. Removing an advisor from their involvement as a student\u2019s advisor or\ncommittee member  \n  \n4\\. Except for Unit 7 Faculty, a possible relocation of a UH employee to\nanother supervisory area may be taken.  \n  \nD. Retaliation Prohibited  \n  \nThe University prohibits and will not tolerate retaliation against persons who\nreport violations of this policy. Persons who commit retaliation in violation\nof this policy are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. \u201cRetaliation\u201d\nis defined in part II.D above.  \n  \nE. Confidentiality  \n  \nIn order to encourage disclosure of consensual relationships prohibited under\nthis policy and to empower members of the University community to voice\nconcerns and file complaints when appropriate, the University will make every\nreasonable effort to conduct all proceedings in a manner that will protect the\nconfidentiality of all parties. The University cannot guarantee\nconfidentiality in all cases, however.  \n  \nF. Examples of Prohibited Relationships  \n  \nThe following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only. This is\nnot intended to be an exhaustive list of situations in which this policy\napplies.  \n  \n1\\. Student A is enrolled in a class taught by Employee B. This policy\nprohibits a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship between faculty members\nand students in classes they instruct.  \n  \n2\\. Employee A is the Master\u2019s thesis advisor for Student B. This policy\nprohibits a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship between advisors and\nstudents they advise.  \n  \n3\\. Employee A serves on Student B\u2019s graduate committee. This policy prohibits\na romantic, dating, or sexual relationship between a student and an employee\nwith influence over that student\u2019s educational status.  \n  \n4\\. Employee A is the faculty advisor for student organization Y. Student B is\na member of organization Y. This policy prohibits a romantic, dating, or\nsexual relationship between advisors and students they advise.  \n  \n5\\. Employee A is an assistant coach for the team that Student B, an athlete\n(scholarship or walk-on) plays on. This policy prohibits a romantic, dating,\nor sexual relationship between coaches and players they coach.  \n  \n6\\. Employee A is dating Student B. Student B is not enrolled any courses\ntaught by Employee A and is majoring in a different department. This policy\ndoes NOT prohibit a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship provided Employee\nA does NOT supervise, direct, instruct, evaluate, advise, or have substantial\ninfluence over Student B\u2019s educational status.  \n  \n7\\. Employee A and Employee B are faculty members in the same department and\nare in a romantic, sexual, or domestic partner relationship. This policy\nrequires the faculty member to disclose the relationship to the department\nchair and to recuse him/herself when evaluative situations arise relating to\nhis/her partner (e.g., evaluative review or voting on special salary\nadjustment, contract renewal, promotion, tenure, etc.).  \n  \n8\\. Employee A and Employee B are staff members in the same department.\nNeither is direct supervisor of the other. This policy does NOT prohibit a\nromantic, dating, or sexual relationship between them since the employees do\nNOT supervise, direct, instruct, evaluate, advise, or have substantial\ninfluence over each other\u2019s employment status.  \n  \n9\\. Employee A is the Dean of a college and Employee B is a faculty member in\nthat college. This policy prohibits a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship\nsince the Dean evaluates and makes employment decisions regarding the faculty\nmember\u2019s promotion, tenure, contract renewal, special salary adjustments, etc.  \n  \nIn a situation where Employee B is a faculty member in a college where\nEmployee A is not Dean, this policy does NOT prohibit a romantic, dating, or\nsexual relationship.  \n  \n10\\. Employee A is Chancellor of the campus. Employee B is a direct report to\nthe Chancellor. This policy prohibits a romantic, dating, or sexual\nrelationship.  \n  \nIn a situation where Employee B is not a direct report to the Chancellor, this\npolicy does NOT prohibit a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship.  \n\n##  IV.

A purchase order is considered a Contract as it is intended to govern\nthe obligations between the University and a vendor. A Contract can be in\nelectronic form, as electronic signatures are permitted under certain\ncircumstances and copies of fully executed agreements that are electronically\ntransmitted can be considered legally binding. Any question as to whether a\ndocument should be considered a Contract should be referred to the\nUniversity\u2019s Office of General Counsel (OGC).  \n  \n\u201c _Counterparty_ \u201d means any person or entity that is a party to a Contract\nwith the University.  \n  \n\u201c _Deans_ \u201d are defined at UH M\u0101noa as the Deans of (1) the College of Arts,\nLanguages & Letters, (2) the School of Architecture, (3) the Shidler College\nof Business, (4) the College of Education, (5) the College of Engineering, (6)\nHawai\u02bbinui\u0101kea School of Hawaiian Knowledge, (7) College of Natural Sciences\n(8) Nancy Atmospera-Walch School of Nursing, (9) the Outreach College, (10)\nthe College of Social Sciences (11) Thompson School of Social Work & Public\nHealth, (12) College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, (13) John A.\nBurns School of Medicine, (14) William S.

For example, in a school or division with an annual budget of $9 million, a non-recurring expenditure of $900,000 would be considered a significant expenditure. This example is intended as a guide, not to be a rigid 10%-of-budget rule.\n\n  \n\"_Template Agreement(s)_ \" are written form agreements that have been approved\nby OGC for a specific purpose.

Executive Policy\n\n### **A._Requirements for All Contracts_**\n\n  \n\n####\n\n**1._Requisite Authority and Delegations of Authority_**  \n**a._Requisite Authority_**  \nExisting board and executive policies and administrative procedures identify\nproper approval and signing authority for different kinds of contracts.\n**Appendix 1** identifies by category of contract those policies and\nprocedures currently in existence, and who must approve and sign various types\nof common obligations or contracts (except in cases of unavailability, when\nany University Officer may sign.) An exception to this exists as to the\nCommunity College Chancellors as noted in Section III.A.1.(b)(3) below.  \n  \nOthers may not sign unless they are University Officers or unless they have\nbeen delegated authority elsewhere in this Policy or other University board or\nexecutive policy or administrative procedure, or in a written document on file\nwith OGC. A listing of the delegations of authority on file with OGC is\navailable to current University employees and students, and can be accessed\nat: http://www.hawaii.edu/offices/legal/contractspolicy/appendices. The table\nalso identifies the appropriate review and approval process required for each\ntype of Contract before signature. If a Contract does not appear on the table,\nconsult OGC to determine the appropriate review and approval process.  \n  \nFaculty, staff, students, consultants, and independent contractors do not have\nauthority to sign Contracts that bind the University.  \n  \nSigning a Contract on behalf of the University is an important responsibility\nand should be done only by someone with the proper authority and an\nunderstanding of the obligations being undertaken. A person who signs a\nContract on behalf of the University knowing he/she lacks authority or in\nreckless disregard of obtaining proper authority, will be in violation of this\nPolicy. In addition, a person who signs without authority in some cases may\neven be personally liable for the obligations, debts and risks under that\nContract, including any payment obligations. The University will not be bound\nby the terms of a Contract signed by an individual without authority unless\nthe University, through an Officer of the University with authority to commit\na sufficient amount of available funding to meet the Contract obligations,\nsubsequently agrees that the University will honor the Contract.  \n  \n**b._Delegation of Authority_**  \n**(1)_The President_**  \nThe President of the University must be informed in advance about all\nSignificant Commitments, before any Significant Commitment is confirmed.\nContracts containing Significant Commitments must be: (a) reviewed and signed\nby an Officer of the University or as otherwise authorized by the President\nand (b) reviewed by OGC.  \n  \n**(2)_Officers_**  \nGenerally, as noted in **Appendix 1**, Officers have authority to approve and\nsign Contracts except those reserved to the President and the Board of\nRegents. The President also may delegate authority to University employees\nother than Officers to sign Contracts on behalf of the University. It is\nexpected that Officers and other authorized University signatories will only\nsign Contracts within their general areas of authority, except in cases of\nunavailability.  \n  \n**(3)_Community College Chancellors_**  \nAuthority to sign contracts for the community colleges has been delegated to\nthe Vice President for Community Colleges. The Vice President for Community\nColleges will delegate as appropriate the signing authority for the community\ncolleges to the community college chancellors. These delegations will be given\nin the manner specified in subparagraph (7) below, and these delegations\nsupersede the authority given to community college chancellors where\n\u201cchancellor\u201d is mentioned in **Appendix 1**.  \n  \n**(4)_Deans_**  \nDeans have authority to approve and sign Contracts that:  \n  \n\n  * _Impact program only_. Impact solely the programs and budgets they oversee; and \n  * _Fall within expenditure threshold_. Involve total expenditures (including any renewal or option terms) that do not exceed $25,000, except for Letters of Hire and Offer Letters that comply with Section III.B.4.e. of this Policy; and\n  *  _No central system impact_. Do not affect central systems or budgets, or those of other divisions or units of the University, _e.g._ , do not affect facilities, position counts of other units; and\n  *  _No unusual risk or liability_. Do not contain terms that could result in unusual risk or liability for the University such as and only by way of example: (a) requiring insurance in excess of normal University policies (_see_ **Appendix 2**) or (b) obligating the University for more than five years in the future.\n\n  \nThis section of the Contracts Policy does not modify nor affect the delegation\nof signing authority as provided by other Executive Policies with respect to\nthe University\u2019s procurement of goods, services and/or construction.  \n  \n**(5)_Fiscal Administrators/Assistant Fiscal Administrators_**  \nGenerally, as noted in **Appendix 1**, Fiscal Administrators and Assistant\nFiscal Administrators have authority to approve and sign Contracts for\nprocuring goods, services, and construction within the limits of their\ndelegated purchasing authority.  \n  \n**(6)_Department Chair, Unit Head, Administrators and Individual Faculty\nMembers_**  \n**(a)_Department Chair/Unit Head_.** The Department Chair or head of the Unit\nwhose budget will bear an expense does not have authority to sign Contracts by\nvirtue of the budgetary effect alone. Contracts can be signed only by the\nadministrators who are named elsewhere in this Policy or by administrators who\nhave been delegated authority to sign that kind of Contract by a delegation on\nfile with Office of General Counsel. A listing of the delegations of authority\non file with OGC is available to current University employees and students,\nand can be accessed at:\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/offices/legal/contractspolicy/appendices.  \n  \n**(b)_Faculty Members_.** While individual faculty members may be essential to\nthe existence of certain Contracts, they do not have authority to sign\nContracts that bind the University.  \n  \n**(c)_Exception_.** At UH M\u0101noa in the Office of the Vice Provost for Student\nSuccess (OVPSS), an exception to subparagraphs (6)(a) and (6)(b) above exist\nfor faculty who are hired as faculty directors that lead specific units within\nOVPSS. These faculty directors have signing authority with the same limits as\nthe UH M\u0101noa deans.  \n**(7)_Further Delegation_**  \nThose who are authorized by policy or procedure to approve and sign Contracts\nmay further delegate their authority, provided that such authority to delegate\nis described in a policy or procedure other than this EP 8.200. Delegation\nmust be in writing and specifically limited by agreement type and dollar\namount. (_See_ **Appendix 3** for Sample Delegation Document). A person to\nwhom authority is delegated cannot then further delegate that authority to\nanother, without the written approval of the person who made the original\ndelegation. The person who delegates authority retains responsibility for the\nactions of the person to whom authority is delegated.  \n  \nA copy of all delegations, re-delegations, or revocation of delegations of\nauthority to approve and sign Contracts must be kept by the Administration of\nrespective campuses, and if executed at the System level, a copy must be sent\nto OGC to be effective and honored by the University. A listing of the\ndelegations of authority on file with OGC is available to current University\nemployees and students, and can be accessed at:\nhttp://www.hawaii.edu/offices/legal/contractspolicy/appendices.  \n  \nCopies of delegations that are temporary or personal, _e.g._ , delegation only\nwhile delegator is out of the office on travel, do not have to be sent to and\nacknowledged by OGC to be effective. This includes delegations that are less\nthan 2 months in duration.  \n  \n\n####\n\n**2._Due Diligence, Adherence to Policies, and Confirmation of Funding_**  \nEmployees who execute Contracts have the responsibility to personally, or\nassign appropriately experienced staff to: (a) review and understand the terms\nof the Contract, (b) verify that the business terms of the Contract are fair\nand reasonable to the University, (c) confirm that the Contract is processed\nin accordance with this Policy and the normal business practices and policies\nof the University relating to initiating a business relationship or\ntransaction, including adherence to applicable procurement requirements, (d)\nconfirm the counterparty business registration and signatory authority (_see_\nSection III.D. Execution of the Contract), and (e) confirm the availability\nand commitment of sufficient funding to meet the University's obligations set\nforth in the Contract.1  \n  \n\n####\n\n**3._Prohibition Against Conflicts of Interest_**  \nIn addition, under Hawai\u02bbi law2 and the University\u2019s policies on conflict of\ninterest,3 a University employee who has a conflict of interest with respect\nto any given Contract does not have authority to sign the Contract and should\nnot be involved in the negotiation of or approval process with respect to the\nContract. This applies whether the subject of the Contract is commercial or\nacademic.  \n  \n\n####\n\n**4._Requirement of a Written Agreement_**  \nAll University Contracts must be in writing, which may include electronic (but\nnot email) form. No contract will bind the University unless in writing and\nsigned in accordance with this Policy. This Policy applies equally to\namendments and terminations of Contracts.  \n  \n\n### **B._Contracts Review Process_**\n\n  \nThe Contracts Review Process set forth in this Section III.B. applies to all\nContracts that are not already subject to review pursuant to a separate policy\nor procedure. Examples of Contracts excluded from this Contracts Review\nProcess (shown also in **Appendix 1**) include the following:  \n  \n\n  * Collective bargaining agreements;\n  * Procurement-related Contracts that already undergo review by the University\u2019s Office of Procurement (OPM), except for contracts relating to information technology commitments (as described in Section III.B.4.f.) and contracts relating to data commitments (as described in Section III.B.4.g.); \n  * Contracts that are reviewed and processed through RCUH unless RCUH is entering into a Contract with the University; and\n  * Research-related agreements that are processed by the Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation, such as sponsored and unsponsored (non-funded) research agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements in anticipation of collaborative research, or technology transfer agreements such as patent licenses.\n\n  \nIf there are particular aspects of these agreements that involve significant\ncommitments or carry inherent risks, the unit designated as the primary\nreviewer may seek additional review or guidance.  \n  \n\n####\n\n**1._Review By Office of General Counsel_**  \nThe following Contracts require OGC review before they can be signed, except\nif Template Agreements are used:  \n  \n\n  * Use of University Facilities by outsiders;\n  * Real estate (including but not limited to leases, easements, purchase/sale, and licenses); \n  * Employment Contracts for coaches and senior administrators; \n  * Endorsements of products/services; \n  * Contracts involving Significant Commitments; \n  * Settlements; and\n  * Financing contracts/commitments, including bonds, loans and guarantees.\n\n  \nExcept for the types of Contracts listed above, OGC review is not required for\nContracts involving expenditures (including any renewal or option terms) that\ndo not exceed $25,000, whether it is over a single year or multiple years.  \n  \nOGC review is not required if a Template Agreement is used for the purpose\nspecified and no substantive deviations or changes are made to the form\ntemplate. If substantive deviations or changes are proposed, OGC review will\nbe required for those changes only.  \n  \nIn general, OGC review is limited to assessing the legality of each Contract\nand the terms affecting such assessment. It does not usually include a review\nand evaluation of the business terms or whether the University should enter\ninto the Contract based on such business terms, with the University\nsignatories remaining ultimately responsible for such decisions. The\nUniversity unit which desires to enter into the Contract or which is\nresponsible for initiating or implementing the Contract, has the primary\nresponsibility to negotiate and review the overall Contract to make sure that\nit is in the best business interests of the University and consistent with\nUniversity policies, including this Policy, to ensure that a risk analysis has\nbeen performed and any identified risks mitigated, and to confirm the\ncounterparty business registration and signatory authority.  \n  \nContracts can include terms that may seem innocuous or insignificant to the\nUniversity units, but may be legally important. All personnel are encouraged\nto consult with the OGC if they have any questions about this Policy, the\nContract Review Process, a Contract, and/or the interpretation of any\nprovisions within a Contract.  \n  \nUse of standard University Contract terms (_see_ Section III.C.) and Template\nAgreements will expedite Contract execution, including when necessary, OGC\nreview. Contracts under $25,000 do not require OGC's review unless there are\nspecific questions that require legal consultation, and any legal service\nrequest seeking OGC review of a Contract under $25,000 should be accompanied\nby a completed checklist found in **Appendix 11**. If units identify\ninconsistencies between the Contract language proposed by counterparties and\nthis Policy, _e.g._ , regarding indemnification, the unit should begin to\nnegotiate with the counterparty to resolve those inconsistencies in the\nUniversity\u2019s favor to the greatest extent possible, prior to or during OGC's\nreview of the Contract. If the inconsistencies cannot be resolved then units\nshould seek higher campus level authorization for answers to policy questions,\nappropriate risk tolerance, or business decisions.  \n  \n\n####\n\n**2._Early Reviews of Significant Commitments By Administration_**  \nAnyone that initiates or becomes involved in a potential Significant\nCommitment on behalf of the University should report the Significant\nCommitment to appropriate University Officers and/or top campus administration\nofficials even before a memorandum of understanding, letter of intent, or a\nContract is prepared.  \n  \n\n####\n\n**3._Review of Insurance Terms_**  \n**a._Contracts Requiring Proof of Other Party Insurance_**  \nThe University has standard insurance requirements that generally apply to\nother entities doing business with the University (_see_ **Appendix 2**). If\nthe counterparty(ies) cannot or will not meet University\u2019s insurance\nrequirements, consideration should be given to selecting another alternative.\nWaivers of or changes to the standard insurance requirements must be approved\nby the office authorized to sign the particular Contract and the University\u2019s\nOffice of Risk Management (ORM), with input from OGC.  \n  \n**b._Contracts Requiring Proof of University Insurance_**  \nContracts often require the University to maintain and show proof of certain\ntypes and amounts of insurance coverage. In general, the University does not\npurchase insurance to cover the University\u2019s performance under the Contracts.\nThe University is considered a \u201cself-insured\u201d entity and certificates to this\neffect may be obtained from the State of Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s risk management office.\nPlease consult with ORM with respect to obtaining such certificates.  \n  \nSome Contracts also require the other party to be named as \u201cadditional\ninsured\u201d under University insurance policies. In virtually all situations,\nnaming the counterparty(ies) as additional insured under any University\ninsurance policy will not be feasible or possible. **Appendix 2** describes\nthe representations that can be made in a Contract about the University\u2019s\ninsurance coverage, without further review by OGC. Contracts that require the\nUniversity to provide insurance of different types or specific amounts must be\nreviewed by ORM, with input from OGC, who may recommend approval by\nappropriate Officers.  \n  \n\n####\n\n**4._Priority Agreements_**  \nThe University believes that certain Contracts carry inherent risk such that\nadditional scrutiny and controls are warranted. For purposes of this Policy,\nthese Contracts are referred to as \u201cPriority Agreements.\u201d Priority Agreements\nmust be signed by a UH Officer or by a delegated authority in accordance with\nthis Policy. The following are \u201cPriority Agreements.\u201d  \n  \n**a._Affiliation/Student Field Experience Agreements_ **  \nThe University enters into numerous affiliation agreements, the purpose of\nwhich is to make available to students a broad range of short-term field and\nclinical experience opportunities.  \n  \n**Appendix 4** contains eleven (11) affiliation agreement templates:  \n  \n\n  * _Four (4) Outbound Affiliation Agreement (Healthcare Facilities) templates_. These templates should be used when placing University students in third-party facilities for a clinical experience, rotation, clerkship or internship in health-related services or care, (_e.g.,_ medicine, nursing, dental, mental health, counseling, athletic training). There are four (4) types of Outbound Affiliation Agreement (Healthcare Facilities) templates depending on the nature of the third-party facility (private, state, county, federal).\n  \n\n  * _Four (4) Outbound Affiliation Agreement (Educational Fieldwork Experience) templates_. These templates are for limited use in placing University students in practicum settings that are low risk and that do not involve students providing health-related services or care. There are four (4) types of Outbound Affiliation Agreement (Educational Fieldwork Experience) templates depending on the nature of the third-party facility (private, state, county, federal).\n  \n\n  * _Two (2) Inbound Affiliation Agreement (Educational Fieldwork Experience) templates_. These templates are for limited use in placing students from another academic institution in a University unit for practicum settings that are low risk and that do not involve students providing health-related services or care. There are two (2) types of Inbound Affiliation Agreement (Educational Fieldwork Experience) templates depending on the nature of the participating student\u2019s home institution (private, state).\n  \n\n  * _One (1) Inbound Affiliation Agreement (Health-related Services) template._ This template is for limited use in placing students from another academic institution in a University unit for a clinical experience, rotation, clerkship or internship in health-related services or care, (_e.g._ , medicine, nursing, dental, mental health, counseling, athletic training).\n\n  \nIf the template agreements are completed without any material changes, they\nneed not be submitted to  \nOGC for review. Any material changes to the template agreements require OGC\nreview before execution.  \n  \n**Appendix 4** also includes a template for authorization and consent for\ndisclosure of personal information for students participating in an\neducational fieldwork or clinical experience under an affiliation agreement.\n_All_ students participating in an educational fieldwork or clinical\nexperience through the University (including University students participating\nin an educational fieldwork or clinical experience at a third-party facility\nand non-University students participating in an educational fieldwork or\nclinical experience at a University facility) will be required to sign an\nauthorization and consent form.  \n  \n**b._Facilities Use Agreements_**  \nEach campus of the University enters into numerous facilities use agreements\ngranting permission to use or rent University facilities for a broad range of\nfunctions. **Appendix 5** contains nine (9) standard facilities use agreement\ntemplates:  \n  \n\n  * two (short form and long form) for UH affiliated users,\n  * two (short form and long form) for non-UH users\n  * two (short form and long form) for State of Hawai\u02bbi government users\n  * two (short form and long form( for Federal government users\n  * one (1) for non-UH users engaged in filming activities\n\n  \n**Appendix 13** (Guidelines regarding UH users and Non-UH Users) sets forth\nguidelines and factors for determining whether a prospective user is a UH user\nor a non-UH user.  \n  \nUnless a prospective user is able to show that it is officially affiliated\nwith the University or a State of Hawai\u02bbi government entity, the non-UH user\nfacilities use agreement templates should be used. UH affiliated users include\n(i) the Board of Regents or a UH System chartered organization; (ii)\nregistered student, faculty, or staff organizations; (iii) UH Campus chartered\norganizations; (iv) University of Hawai\u02bbi Foundation; (v) \u02bbAhahui Koa \u0100nuenue;\n(vi) University Clinical, Education, and Research Associates dba University\nHealth Partners of Hawai\u02bbi; and (vii) Hawai\u02bbi State Cancer Consortium. RCUH\nshould use the template for State of Hawai\u02bbi government users.  \n  \nFacilities use agreements should be used when the use of University\nproperty/facilities by a non-UH user is a one-time, sporadic, occasional, or\nperiodic use, _i.e._ , less than 30 consecutive days or 30 days per fiscal or\ncalendar year. If the contemplated use exceeds these timeframes, use and\noccupancy agreements, right of entry agreements, leases or other similar\nrental agreements should be used (_see_ Section III.B.7.). All of these\nagreements allowing entry onto and/or use and occupancy of University owned,\nleased, or controlled property are considered real property documents and are\ncovered by Board of Regents Policy RP 10.201. Real property agreements at\nleast require the approval of the Vice President for Budget and Finance or\nhis/her designee, if not the President or the Board, as well as the approval\nof the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs and University General\nCounsel as to form.  \n  \nIf the template facilities use agreements are completed without any material\nchanges, they need not be submitted to OGC for review prior to execution. Any\nmaterial changes to the template agreements require OGC review before\nexecution.  \n  \n**(1)_Long and Short Form Agreements in General_**  \nBoth long and short form agreements require consideration of use of\nappropriate waiver and release forms in connection with the activities or\nevents conducted on University property/facilities. _See_ template facilities\nuse agreements and Section III.B.6.a. (Waiver and Release Forms) below for\ndescriptions and samples of waiver and release forms.  \n  \nThe long form agreement templates should be used when: (a) expected attendance\nis more than 200 people, (b) the time of use is more than seven (7) days, or\n(c) the rental or use fee is greater than $5,000. Conversely, the short form\nagreement templates should be used when: (a) expected attendance is 200 people\nor fewer, (b) the time of use is (7) seven days or fewer, and (c) the rental\nor use fee is $5,000 or less.  \n  \nTo the extent that any changes are sought to the standard insurance provisions\nin any of the long form facilities use agreements, approval must be obtained\nfrom ORM.  \n  \nBoth long form facilities use agreements contain: (a) a requirement to obtain\npollution liability insurance unless the UH Campus determines that hazardous\nmaterials will not be used in connection with the event and (b) optional\nprovisions which specify the conditions under which food and alcohol may be\nserved at the event.  \n  \nThe long form agreement for non-UH users also contain the following optional\nprovisions:  \n  \n(a) _Optional fees/charges._ Charge the non-UH user: (1) a percentage of the\ngross revenues received by the non-UH user for the event, _i.e._ ,\nparticipation fee, and/or (2) a ticketing fee if the University would like to\nrequire the non-UH user to use the University\u2019s ticketing system for the\nevent.  \n  \n(b) _Guarantor._ Require the non-UH user to have another person or entity\ncommit to guarantee that the non-UH user will perform and complete its\nobligations under the facilities use agreement. A guarantor is required when:\n(1) expected attendance is more than 500 people, (2) time of use exceeds\nfourteen (14) days, or (3) the Rental Fee exceeds $50,000.  \nBoth short form facilities use agreements contain provisions that the\nUniversity may elect to include, such as provisions under which: (i) food and\nalcohol may be served at the event and (ii) standard insurance coverage could\nbe required. In addition, if the UH Campus determines that hazardous materials\nmay or could be used in connection with the event, the University could elect\nto require the user to comply with certain standard hazardous materials\nprovisions, including obtaining pollution liability insurance.  \n  \n**(2)_State of Hawai\u2019i Government Users_**  \nThe facilities use agreement templates (long and short form) for State of\nHawai\u02bbi government users should be used when the non-UH user is any of the\nState of Hawai\u02bbi government entities, including but not limited to, the RCUH,\nthe Department of Education (including individual public schools and/or\ncomplexes), the Hawai\u02bbi Community Development Authority, and the Office of\nHawaiian Affairs.  \n  \nThe primary differences with the State government user facilities use\nagreement template include: (1) replacing the indemnity requirement with the\nstandard State of Hawai\u02bbi responsibility obligation and (2) allowing the State\nto satisfy the insurance requirement through its self-insurance program.  \n  \n**(3)_Federal Government Users_**  \nThe facilities use agreement templates (long and short form) for federal\ngovernment users should be used when the non-UH user is an office, agency or\nbureau of a United States federal government entity, such as the Natural\nResources Conservation Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration.  \n  \nThe primary differences with the federal government user facilities use\nagreement template include: (1) replacing the indemnity requirement with a\nstatement on the federal government user\u2019s liability under the United States\nFederal Tort Claims Act, (2) allowing the federal government user to satisfy\nthe insurance requirement through a Proof of Insurance and Liability of the\nGovernment certificate, and (3) an acknowledgement that the federal government\nuser\u2019s obligation to perform, make payments and/or assume liability under the\nagreement is subject to funds being properly appropriated for such purpose.  \n  \n**(4)_Facilities Use Agreement for Filiming_**  \nA facilities use agreement for filming has been developed specifically for use\nwhen a non-UH user requests to use or rent University facilities to conduct\nfilming activities, on either a commercial or not-for-profit basis. The\nfacilities use agreement for filming is similar to the standard facilities use\nagreement templates, but includes provisions that grant the user the right to\nuse and distribute photographs, video and sound recordings generated by its\nfilming activities on University facilities under certain conditions.  \n  \n**c._International Agreements_.**  \nThe additional review and signing authority requirements set forth in this\nSection III.B.4.c. applies to all international agreements that are not\nalready reviewed pursuant to a separate policy or procedure, namely (1) those\nresearch agreements processed in accordance with EP 12.102, Authority to Sign\nand Execute Extramural Research and Training Contracts/Grants, Agreements and\nContract Assignments and Releases, and (2) agreements with foreign entities\nfor the procurement of goods and/or services that are reviewed by OPM. In\nother words, agreements reviewed by the Office of the Vice President for\nResearch and Innovation, the Office of Research Services or OPM do not need to\nfollow this section of the Contracts Policy since those agreements are already\nsubject to review pursuant to a separate policy or procedure.  \n  \nBecause of the unusual compliance and risk issues associated with transactions\ninvolving a foreign party, all international agreements under the purview of\nthis Policy section (i) must be reviewed by the appropriate campus and System\noffices as specified below, (ii) screened by the Office of Export Controls\n(\"OEC\") for export control concerns, and (iii) signed on behalf of the\nUniversity by the President or designee. A copy of the fully executed\ninternational agreement must be sent to the Office of the Vice President for\nAcademic Strategy (\"OVPAS\").  \n  \nEarly Campus Internal Vetting. Each campus must have an internal vetting\nprocess for international agreements in which there are early reviews of the\ndraft agreement by the campus Provost and/or Vice Provost (in the case of UH\nM\u0101noa) or Chancellor or Vice Chancellor Offices, and other appropriate campus,\ncollege and/or department offices as determined by each campus. These reviews\nmust be completed and any issues identified addressed prior to the forwarding\nof these agreements to the other System Offices for review.  \n  \n_Accreditation._ At the earliest stage of discussions concerning an initiative\ninvolving a foreign party, the campus must determine how the initiative could\nimpact its U.S. accreditation and whether the initiative will trigger the\nrequirement of notices to or requests for approval from the accrediting body.\nTo ensure all parties involved in the negotiation have realistic expectations\nabout the timing and nature of the collaboration, the campus should be very\nclear with the foreign party about U.S. accreditation requirements.  \n  \n_Physical Presence._ Where a draft agreement requires that an office, other\nphysical presence, or operations will be maintained by or on behalf of the\nUniversity in other countries, whether by University employees or agents, the\ndraft should be reviewed as early as possible by campus administration,\nincluding the UH M\u0101noa Provost or Chancellor, as applicable, as well as\nPresident and appropriate Vice Presidents. OGC must review all international\nagreements that send UH employees to work in another country as part of their\nUH work.  \n  \n_Additional contracting terms._ When contracting with foreign entities to\nconduct research or academic programs abroad, the University may require in\nthe agreement that the foreign party make various certifications and\nrepresentations regarding its compliance with applicable law and regulations,\nincluding federal sponsor terms and conditions where applicable, trade\ncontrols, and anti-corruption laws.  \n  \n_Participant Waivers._ Given the potential risks to personal health and safety\nassociated with out-of-state, international, and overseas travel and residence\nin another state, territory, or foreign country, consideration should be given\nto using student participation agreements that include an assumption of risk,\nconsent, waiver, release, and indemnity. Two (2) template participation,\nwaiver and release forms for students participating in an out-of-state or\ninternational exchange or study abroad program are found in **Appendix 6**,\none for use by University students participating in an out-of-state or\ninternational exchange or study abroad program (outbound students), and the\nother for students from out-of-state or international institutions who will be\nparticipating in an international exchange program at a University campus\n(inbound students).  \n  \n_UHM Study Abroad Center._ At UH M\u0101noa, any UH M\u0101noa credit course that is\noffered abroad must also be reviewed and recommended for approval by the\nCouncil on Study Abroad (the policy advisory body of the UHM Study Abroad\nCenter). The Study Abroad Center has been identified as the UH M\u0101noa unit that\nspecializes in minimizing the risk and liability to the University, _e.g._ ,\nhealth, safety and security, while delivering academic programs to the\nUniversity\u2019s students at overseas locations. The Study Abroad Center also\nprovides training to faculty members in health, safety, risk, and liability\nareas as well as conducts pre-departure cross-cultural training for UHM\nstudents.  \n  \nIndividual students or faculty intermittent travel contracts are outside the\nscope of this Policy.  \n  \n**Appendix 6** contains the following international agreement templates:  \n  \n\n  * _Memorandum of Understanding for Cooperation and Exchange (MOU)_. The MOU should be used for establishing a broad context and intent for inter-institutional cooperation through the exchange of faculty, scholars, students, academic information and materials.\n  \n\n  * _Service Agreement_. The Service Agreement should be used for retaining the services of an international representative to provide information about educational opportunities at a University campus and to recruit prospective international students to attend a University campus or program.\n  \n\n  * _Memorandum of Agreement (Customized Programs)_. The Memorandum of Agreement should be used to formalize an arrangement where a University campus, college, school, department or unit plans, implements and/or coordinates a customized, short-term, non-credit program for a group of international students or professionals.\n  \n\n  * _Memorandum of Agreement (Student Exchange)_. The Memorandum of Agreement should be used to formalize an arrangement where a University campus and another institution agree to an exchange of students.\n  \n\n  * _Memorandum of Agreement (3+2 Program)_. The Memorandum of Agreement should be used to formalize an arrangement between a University campus and an institution in China where students pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree at the Chinese institution may have an opportunity for an early start in pursuing a master\u2019s degree at the University campus. \n  \n\n  * _Transfer and Articulation Agreement (2+2 Program)._ The Transfer and Articulation Agreement should be used to formalize an arrangement between a University campus and a foreign institution where students who complete the prescribed course of study at the foreign institution may be eligible for acceptance to a bachelor\u2019s degree program at the University campus.\n  \n\n  * _Memorandum of Agreement for UHCCs (Student, Faculty, Scholar, Staff and/or Administrator Exchange)_. The Memorandum of Agreement should be used to formalize an arrangement where the UH Community Colleges system office or an individual UH Community College campus and another institution agree to an exchange of students, faculty, scholars, staff and/or administrators.\n  \n\n  * _Memorandum of Agreement (International Visiting Students)_. The Memorandum of Agreement should be used to formalize an arrangement where qualified, non-degree seeking visiting students from a foreign institution may take courses at a University campus for one or two semesters at a special tuition rate with the intent of fulfilling some of the visiting students\u2019 degree requirements at their home institution and/or earning an academic certificate or other qualification from the University campus (when available).\n  \n\n  * _Participation, Assumption of Risk, Consent, Waiver, Release and Indemnity Agreement (Outbound Students)_. Consideration should be given to using the Participation, Assumption of Risk, Consent, Waiver, Release and Indemnity Agreement for University students participating in an out-of-state or international exchange or study abroad program.\n  \n\n  * _Participation, Assumption of Risk, Consent, Waiver, Release and Indemnity Agreement (Inbound Students)_. A Participation, Assumption of Risk, Consent, Waiver, Release and Indemnity Agreement for Inbound Students should be required of students from out-of-state or international institutions who will be participating in an international exchange program at a University campus.\n\n  \nIf a University template agreement in **Appendix 6** is used without any\nmaterial changes, no further OGC review is required. Any material deviations\nor changes require OGC review before execution.  \n  \n**d._Minors on Campus_ **  \nColleges and schools of each campus of the University host and are part of\nprograms that involve minors. The University as a post-secondary institution\nis generally geared to working with students aged 18 and older. Thus, special\nattention needs to be given to arrangements and agreements that involve\nminors. Thus, these agreements must be reviewed by OVPAS and OGC, and must be\nsigned by the President as the chief executive officer of UH M\u0101noa ,\nChancellor of the other 4-year University campuses, or the Vice President for\nCommunity Colleges, as applicable, or their respective designees, and the\nstudent affairs office of the appropriate campus. The agreements must also\ncomply with Executive Policy EP 2.202, Safety and Protection of Minors, and\nAdministrative Procedure AP 2.202, Background Check Process for University\nCommunity Members and Non-UH Volunteers.  \n  \nIn agreements that have minors dually enrolled as students in a University\nprogram and a K-12 school, _e.g._ Early College, there should be provisions\nthat delineate the responsibilities of each institution in the event that the\ndually enrolled student or employee in the joint program violates either\ninstitution\u2019s policies. **Appendix 16** contains a recommended sample\nprovision.  \n  \n**(1)_Waiver and Release Forms_**  \nConsideration should be given to using parental/guardian waiver and release\nforms in connection with events involving minors. _See_ Section III.B.6.a.\n(Waiver and Release Forms) below for descriptions and samples of waiver and\nrelease forms.  \n  \n**(2)_Screening of Employees_ **  \nConsideration should be given to further screening employees who will possibly\nwork with minors. All University instructors who work directly with State of\nHawai\u02bbi Department of Education (DOE) students through the Early College, Dual\nCredit, Running Start and other P-20 Programs shall be subject to DOE\u2019s\nbackground check procedures.  \n  \n**e._Letters of Hire for Employees_**  \nColleges and schools of each campus of the University issue numerous letters\nof hire. No other employment contracts are allowed unless they are\nspecifically provided for and in compliance with applicable University\npolicies and procedures.  \n  \n**(1)_Offer Letter Templates_**  \nThe University System Office of Human Resources has developed Offer Letter\nTemplates that can be used and/or adapted to fit most employment situations,\nfound in **Appendix 8**. The intent is to streamline and expedite the\nprocessing of offer letters in part by exempting from further review the use\nof templates that do not deviate from or change the template terms and are in\ncompliance with the University\u2019s policies on compensation and hiring.  \n  \n**(2)_Authority to Approve and Execute Letters of Hire_**  \nAny deviations or changes to the Offer Letter Templates and the University\u2019s\npolicies must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Vice Chancellor, or\nUH M\u0101noa Vice Provost, or if at the System, by the Director of the Office of\nHuman Resources. Any Letters of Hire or offer letters that do not conform to\nthe following conditions must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Vice\nChancellor, or UH M\u0101noa Vice Provost or if at the System, by the Vice\nPresident for Administration.  \n  \n**(3)_Mandatory Conditions for Letters of Hire_**  \nLetters of Hire must comply with the following:  \n  \n1) _Program-only impact_. Impact solely the programs and budgets overseen by\nthe issuer of the Letter of Hire;  \n  \n2) _No central system impact_. Do not affect central systems or budgets, or\nthose of other divisions or units of the University, _e.g._ , do not affect\nfacilities or involve alteration to existing space or creation of new space,\nand position counts of other units, unless prior approval has been obtained\nfrom the appropriate Chancellor or Vice Chancellor, UH M\u0101noa Provost or Vice\nProvost, and Vice President (or VP\u2019s respective designee);  \n  \n3) _No unusual risk or liability_. Do not contain terms that could result in\nunusual risk or substantial liability for the University. ORM should be\nconsulted with if any questions arise regarding the nature of the risk or\nliability.  \n  \n4) _Conforming employee workload_. Involve faculty workload or staff\nassignments that are in conformance with the collective bargaining agreements,\nUniversity policies, and the policy of the specific University unit.  \n  \n5) _No start-up costs or special arrangements_. For UH M\u0101noa, letters of hire\nshall not include: (a) \u201cStart-up Costs\u201d (as defined below) in excess of\n$250,000, unless higher authority has been specifically approved by the\nProvost and appropriate Vice Provost, or (b) other special arrangements,\n_e.g._ , reduced teaching load beyond two years. Start-up Costs shall not be\nconsidered or treated as wages or as terms or conditions of employment or\ninvolving any other issue that might be covered by the collective bargaining\nagreement or otherwise require consultation with the relevant labor union.  \nFor UH West O\u02bbahu, UH Hilo and all Community Colleges, no Start-Up Costs will\nbe included in any Letters of Hire, unless prior approval has been obtained\nfrom the (1) Chancellor of UH West O\u02bbahu for UH West O\u02bbahu letters; (2)\nChancellor of UH Hilo for UH Hilo letters; and (3) Vice President for\nCommunity Colleges for any Community College letters.  \n  \n\u201cStart-up Costs\u201d are costs to the University beyond the normal salary for\nfaculty to help them with their work. These costs can include but are not\nlimited to funds for laboratory supplies, equipment, support staff,\nfacilities, laboratory space, office space, computers and software, travel\nsupport and submission and publication fees. Support staff can include\nadministrative/clerical support, students and postdocs.  \n  \n**(4)_Conditions for Accepted Letters of Hire_**  \nLetters of Hire involving an employee in Bargaining Unit 07 must comply with\nArticle III, Conditions of Service, Paragraph I, Letters of Hire, of the\n2021-2025 Unit 7 Agreement.  \n  \n**f._Information Technology Purchases_**  \nIn addition to normal procurement procedures, the Office of the Vice President\nfor Information Technology and/or Chief Information Officer (\u201cOVPIT/CIO\u201d) is\nalso required to review and approve the following types of proposed contracts\nand transactions, in accordance with the processes described below:  \n  \n**(1)_Purchases of electronic equipment, hardware, software, and related\nservices._** Proposed contracts (including purchase orders) relating to the\npurchase of electronic equipment, hardware, software, and related services\nthat meet at least one of the following criteria:  \n  \n(a) Exceeds $25,000 in the aggregate, whether it is over a single year or\nmultiple years; or  \n  \n(b) Is required to interact or integrate with UH institutional information\nsystems (_e.g.,_ Banner, STAR) managed by ITS, regardless of dollar value; or  \n  \n(c) Requires ITS technical assistance or support (_e.g.,_ ITS assistance is\nneeded to determine if a credit card terminal meets regulatory compliance, or\nto create a data feed from the UH Identity Management System, or a unit-\ndeveloped application requires a connection (API) to Kuali Build), regardless\nof the dollar value of the proposed contract.  \nShould any purchase involve the use or exchange of data from the University\u2019s\ninstitutional data systems, the Data Governance Process (\u201cDGP\u201d) will supersede\nthis OVPIT Approval for IT Procurement process.  \n  \nContracts that require the review and approval of OVPIT/CIO as provided above,\nmust be processed through OVPIT/CIO\u2019s Procurement Approval Request process\navailable at: https://www.hawaii.edu/its/support-tools/ (select \u201cRequest OVPIT\napproval for IT procurement\u201d).  \n  \n**(2)_Software/subscriptions between $2,500-$25,000_**. Purchases of\nsoftware/subscriptions in this dollar range that do not involve Protected Data\n(see definition in Section III.B.4.g. below) are not subject to any OVPIT/CIO\nprocess. Requesting units should work with their fiscal authorities to modify\nor remove noncompliant or unfavorable procurement terms.  \n  \n**(3)_Shrink-wrapped software/subscriptions (less than $2,500)_**. Small\npurchase transactions (P-card) relating to the purchase of \u201cshrink-wrapped\u201d\nsoftware and software subscriptions that:  \n  \n(a) do not exceed $2,500 in the aggregate, whether it is over a single year or\nmultiple years; and  \n  \n(b) contain \u201cclick-to-accept\u201d terms required by the vendor during the purchase\nprocess and do not allow for modification by the University; and  \n  \n(c) contain terms that are inconsistent with this Policy, _e.g._ , regarding\nindemnification, governing law and jurisdiction.  \nThese purchases must be processed through the \u201cRequest OVPIT approval for non-\ncompliant terms (shrinkwrap terms) waiver\u201d available at:\nhttps://www.hawaii.edu/its/support-tools/.  \n  \nRequesting units are generally required to attempt negotiations with the\nvendor to modify or remove inconsistent terms prior to submitting a request\nfor the review and approval of OVPIT/CIO. Agreements that require signatures\nshould not be run through the shrink-wrapped software/subscriptions process.\nRequesting units should work with their fiscal authorities to negotiate terms\nbefore signing.  \n  \n**g._Data Commitments Involving Software and/or Services_**  \nThe UH System Data Governance Office (\u201cDGO\u201d) reviews proposed contracts for\nsoftware and/or services from parties outside of the University that involve\nthe collection, management, sharing, exchange, use and/or release of Protected\nData (as defined below), regardless of the dollar value of the contract. This\nreview process applies to software and services being purchased for both\ninstitutional (academic and administrative) purposes and research projects,\nregardless of dollar value of the contract. Software to which this Policy\napplies includes, without limitation, software that is hosted on a UH server\nor a non-UH server. Services to which this Policy applies includes, without\nlimitation, outsourced institutional functions, education-related studies, and\ncloud-related services.  \n  \n\u201cProtected Data\u201d refers to data subject to privacy and/or security\nconsiderations, _i.e._ , data that is not public. This includes Restricted,\nSensitive, and Regulated data as defined by Executive Policy EP 2.214,\nInstitutional Data Classification Categories and Information Security\nGuidelines.  \n  \nAdditionally, any contracts for information technology products or services,\nincluding cloud-based applications that require integration with any\ncentrally-managed UH information system, such as Banner, Peoplesoft, and the\nKuali Financial System are subject to this provision. This includes, without\nlimitation, any type of data activity involving UH information systems.  \n  \nThe following table summarizes the types of contracts reviewed by DGO and the\nsignature authorities for those software and service contracts. Other types of\nagreements are also reviewed by DGO but are outside the scope of this section.\nFor more information, go to https://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/dgp/  \n  \n  \n  \n| Type of software and/or services involving Protected Data  \n| Where to submit  \n| Who signs  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n  \n  \nPurchases or service contracts  \n  \n| DGO via Data Governance Process available at\nhttps://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/dgp/  \n  \n| OVPIT  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nServices with educational institutions or national education  \nrelated non-profit organizations  \n  \n| DGO via Data Governance Process available at\nhttps://datagov.intranet.hawaii.edu/dgp/  \n  \n| OVPAS  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nIn approving any of the foregoing contracts, OVPIT and/or UH DGO may require\nthe inclusion of appropriate contractual provisions, including, without\nlimitation, all or a portion of the sample provisions contained in **Appendix\n9A** (Data Sharing Protections and Requirements for Identified Data) and\n**Appendix 9B** (Data Sharing Protections and Requirements for De-Identified\nData).  \n  \nThe review and approval process in this Section III.B.4.g. should be done\nconcurrently with the OPM and OGC review process (when applicable).  \n  \n\n####\n\n5\\. _Records_  \nContracts as defined in this Policy are University records. Retention of\ncontract documents, including keeping the original signed Contract, should\nfollow EP 2.216 Institutional Records Management and Electronic\nApprovals/Signatures and AP 8.450 Records Management.  \n  \n\n####\n\n6\\. _Template Agreements_  \nIn addition to the Template Agreements attached as Appendices 4, 5, 6 and 8,\nthe following templates have been approved by OGC:  \n  \n\n**a._Waiver and Release Forms_**\n\n  \n**Appendix 7** contains the following waiver and release templates for use in\nconnection with the types of events and activities described below. These\nwaiver and release forms supersede and replace the waiver and release forms\ncontained in AP 8.400.  \n  \n\n  * _University-Sponsored One-Time Events_. Template waiver and release forms appropriate for adults (aged 18 years or older) (**Appendix 7**) and minors (aged 17 years or younger) (**Appendix 7A**) participating in one-time events sponsored by a University unit, irrespective of whether such events take place on or off University-owned or controlled property. The waiver and release forms contained in Appendices 7 and 7A should be required of all participants (other than University employees participating in connection with their employment) for events that involve potentially or inherently hazardous and dangerous activities and/or conditions.\n  \n\n  * _Non-University Events_. Template waiver and release forms appropriate for individual adults (aged 18 years or older) (**Appendix 7B**), individual minors (aged 17 years or younger) (**Appendix 7C**), multiple adults (aged 18 years or older) (**Appendix 7D**) and multiple minors (aged 17 years or younger) (**Appendix 7E**) participating in one-time events taking place on University-owned or controlled property and sponsored by a non-University entity. The waiver and release forms contained in Appendices 7B through 7E are intended for use in conjunction with events conducted pursuant to facilities use agreements (_see_ Section III.B.4.b. above) in situations where (1) participants are required to register to attend the event and/or sign a waiver and release form due to the potentially or inherently hazardous and dangerous activities and/or conditions involved with the event, and (2) the University, in consultation with the sponsoring entity, elects to require the sponsoring entity to use the applicable waiver and release form contained in Appendices 7B through 7E.\n  \n\n  * _Online Learning Activities_. Template authorization and release forms appropriate for adults (aged 18 years or older) (**Appendix 7F**) and minors (aged 17 years or younger) (**Appendix 7G**) participating in online learning activities sponsored by a University unit. The authorization and release forms contained in Appendices 7F and 7G should be required of all participants (other than University employees participating in connection with their employment) of online learning activities that involve class sessions and projects being photographed, video-recorded and/or audio-recorded for rebroadcast, retransmission or publication.\n  \n\n  * _Media Release Form_. Template authorization and release form (**Appendix 7H**) for individuals (adults or minors) participating in activities conducted by a University unit or student that involve participants being photographed, video-recorded and/or audio-recorded for rebroadcast, retransmission or publication.\n\n  \n\n**b._Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement_**\n\n  \nThe template Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) contained in **Appendix\n14** may be used when the University and a third party wish to exchange and\nprotect confidential information to facilitate discussions and negotiations\nleading to possible collaborative research or other business arrangements, and\nwhere neither party pays a fee for the exchange and safeguarding of\nconfidential information. The template includes optional acknowledgments for\nsituations in which University principal investigator(s) and/or students will\nbe provided access to the confidential information governed by an NDA.  \n  \nIf the template NDA is used without any material changes, no further OGC\nreview is required. Any material deviations or changes require OGC review\nbefore execution. A complex real property or commercial transaction may\nrequire a more involved NDA, and consultation with OGC is encouraged.  \n  \n\n**c._ U.S. Transfer and Articulation Agreement_**\n\n  \nThe Transfer and Articulation Agreement contained in **Appendix 17** should be\nused to formalize an arrangement between a University campus and another U.S.\ninstitution (\u201cUS Affiliate\u201d) where US Affiliate students who successfully\ncomplete specified courses or a prescribed course of study at the US Affiliate\nwill receive credit hours at the University campus and/or may be eligible for\nacceptance to a bachelor\u2019s degree program at the University campus.  \n  \n**7._Right of Entry and Use and Occupancy Agreement Templates_**  \n  \nThe following real property agreement templates have been approved by OGC and\nincluded in **Appendix 15** (Template Property Agreements). The Template\nProperty Agreements are considered forms pre-approved by OGC consistent with\nthe requirements contained in RP 10.201. Therefore, no \u201capproved as to form\u201d\nsignature blocks for OGC are included on the Template Property Agreements.  \n  \nTo the extent that there are any additional conditions or requirements, such\nconditions may be added as a separate Exhibit C (Special Conditions) to the\napplicable right of entry agreement or use and occupancy agreement. Such\nconditions could include designating specific access routes, limiting\nactivities to certain hours, and implementing measures to protect or reduce\nany specific adverse impacts on facilities, significant campus features,\nutility systems or adjacent use areas (such as noise, dust, and vandalism and\ndamage). Adding special conditions would require OGC review prior to\nsubmission to the Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief Financial\nOfficer (VPBF) or the Director of Strategic Development and Partnership (OSDP\nDirector), as appropriate. OGC will insert an OGC approved as to form\nsignature block for such Template Property Agreement.  \n  \nIf a Template Property Agreement is used for its specified purpose without any\nmaterial changes, no further OGC review is required. Such Template Property\nAgreement, however, must be signed by either the VPBF or the OSDP Director, as\nsuch authority has been delegated under Board of Regents Policy RP 10.201.  \n  \n\n**a._Right of Entry Agreements for Non-Invasive/Investigative Work_**\n\n  \nThis set of templates provides a third party (usually consultants retained by\na prospective developer or government entity interested in a specific project)\nthe ability to enter University property to conduct limited non-invasive\ninvestigative/due diligence work:  \n  \n\n(1) Consultant Non-Invasive Right of Entry Agreement.  \n(2) State of Hawaii Government Non-Invasive Right of Entry Agreement.  \n(3) County Government Non-Invasive Right of Entry Agreement.\n\n  \n\n**b._Use and Occupancy Agreements for Nearby Construction Projects_**\n\n  \nThis second set of templates authorizes a third party (usually a contractor or\na government agency) to use and occupy University property to support nearby\nconstruction projects. Examples of such uses are to access the project\nconstruction area, store construction materials, dry out dredged sludge, and\npark/stage vehicles and equipment:  \n  \n\n(1) Private Party Construction Support Use and Occupancy Agreement.  \n(2) State of Hawaii Government Construction Support Use and Occupancy\nAgreement.  \n(3) County Government Construction Support Use and Occupancy Agreement.\n\n  \n**\n\n### C._Specific Provisions in Contracts_\n\n**  \nWhen preparing contracts involving the University as a party, there are a\nnumber of common legal issues that may need to be addressed. To assist you in\nyour review of contract provisions, a contract issue checklist has been\nprepared and is attached as **Appendix 11**. The following section also\nprovides guidelines for addressing some of these common legal issues. OGC may\nalways be consulted on issues or concerns beyond the scope of this Policy and\nthese guidelines, or when the third party rejects the University\u2019s standard\nprovisions or its Template Agreements.  \n  \n\n####\n\n1\\. _Proper Party._  \nThe University of Hawai\u02bbi is the State university and a body corporate of the\nState of Hawai\u02bbi. In all agreements involving the University of Hawai\u02bbi as a\nparty, the University should be named as follows: \u201cUniversity of Hawai\u02bbi, the\nstate university and body corporate of the State of Hawai\u02bbi.\u201d The University\nof Hawai\u02bbi is the only legal entity that is capable of contracting as a party,\nand the individual campuses are not separate legal entities.  \n  \n\n####\n\n2\\. _Address._  \nThe address designated in the Contract for the University of Hawai\u02bbi should be\nBachman Hall, 2444 Dole Street, Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi. The address of the\nresponsible campus/department/unit/administrator may be added in the manner\ndescribed in the next paragraph.  \n  \n\n####\n\n3\\. _Identify Responsible Campus/Department/Unit/Administrator._  \nThe specific campus/department/unit/administrator responsible for\nadministration of the Contract should be identified in the Contract. The\nfollowing can be added after the identification of the University of Hawai\u02bbi\nas the contracting party: \u201cfor the benefit of [Name of University of Hawai\u02bbi\ncampus, college, school, institute, center, department, office, or other\nunit], whose business address is [appropriate address of the University of\nHawai\u02bbi campus, college, school, institute, center, department, office, or\nother unit].\u201d  \n  \n\n####\n\n4\\. _Contract Scope, Deliverables and Deadlines._  \nIt is critical that each Contract identify and describe with sufficient\nparticularity and detail the subject matter of the Contract, including the\ngoods, services, and/or benefits that the University will be receiving, the\nobligations the University is being required to commit to perform, the\nobligations to be performed by other parties to the Contract, the payment\namounts, and the time frame/deadlines for performance. For Contracts having\nextended terms, consideration should be given to establishing certain\nperformance milestones that need to be achieved before the counterparty(ies)\nwould be entitled to payment for such milestone or milestones so achieved.\nSome of the more specific issues to check in your review include:  \n  \n\n**a._Consideration_.** Determine the consideration or items of value being\nprovided by each party, _e.g._ , cash payment for a product/service or a\npromise to do or refrain from doing an action.  \n  \n**b._Term or Duration of Contract_**. Identify the term/duration of the\nContract, including a specific beginning and end date and whether there are\noptions to renew. Automatic renewals without end, or \u201cevergreen\u201d contracts,\nare _prohibited_. If the Contract is for a multi-year term, the University\u2019s\nstandard \u201csubject to funding\u201d provision (below) covering future years should\nbe inserted as the University is usually only able to commit to funding the\ncurrent year of the Contract.\n\n  \n\n####\n\n5\\. _Payment Terms._  \nThe Contract should accurately describe with sufficient detail the payment\nterms, including the payment amounts and the time frame/ deadlines/\nrequirements for payment. Clearly identify the amount and extent of the\nparty\u2019s responsibility to pay for costs associated with contract performance.  \n  \n\n**a._Reimbursement of Expenses_**. If expense reimbursement is required by the\nUniversity, the other party should be required to submit documentation, _e.g._\n, receipts, acceptable to the University as a precondition to being\nreimbursed. A ceiling or maximum limit should be established for any expense\nreimbursement obligation of the University.  \n  \n**b._Sharing monies collected_**. If the other party is collecting money and\npaying a portion to the University, _e.g._ , a concession agreement, the\namounts (whether or not based on a percentage of the monies collected) should\nbe clear. The Contract should include the University\u2019s right to review and\naudit the records of the other party to verify that the University has\nreceived the correct amount.\n\n  \n\n####\n\n6\\. _Indemnification._  \nExcept for four (4) limited circumstances, the University is not legally\nauthorized or permitted to indemnify, defend or hold harmless other parties to\na Contract (\u201cOther Parties\u201d) against claims by a third party (not a party to\nthe Contract) for damage or injuries resulting from the acts or omissions of\nthe University. To agree to such obligations would require the University to:\n(1) defend the Other Parties against third party claims, which includes paying\nfor the Other Parties\u2019 defense costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees; and (2) pay\nfor any monetary judgment obtained against the Other Parties by third party\nclaimants. **Appendix 12** (Guidelines re Indemnification Issues) sets forth\nadditional guidelines regarding the University\u2019s authority to indemnify Other\nParties against third party claims.  \n  \n\n####\n\n7\\. _Subject to Funding._  \nUniversity employees are not legally permitted to commit the University to\nobligations in excess of available and authorized funding. Because of this,\nunless all of the funding necessary to meet or satisfy all obligations under\nthe Contract has been approved, authorized, and made available for payment\nunder the Contract, the following condition should be included to qualify the\nUniversity\u2019s obligation to perform any obligations for which funding has not\nyet been obtained:  \n  \n\n\u201c _Subject to Funding_. To the extent that the University is: (1) obligated to\nperform under this Agreement, (2) obligated to make any payments under this\nAgreement, or (3) deemed liable under this Agreement, the University\u2019s ability\nto satisfy such obligations or liabilities, particularly any obligations\nrequiring the payment of any amount of monies, is limited to that which is\npermitted by law and is subject to the condition that funds are properly\nappropriated, allotted, or otherwise properly made available for the purpose\nof satisfying such obligations or liabilities.  \n  \na. _University Limitations_. [Name of other contracting party] and the\nUniversity acknowledge and agree that paragraphs ___ (University\nResponsibility) and ___ (Subject to Funding) are hereafter collectively the\n\u201cUniversity Limitations.\u201d  \n  \nb. _University obligations subject to University Limitations_. Notwithstanding\nand superseding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (and any\nexhibits attached to this Agreement), any and all obligations, duties,\nresponsibilities, and liabilities of the University under this Agreement are\nexpressly subject to and limited by the University Limitations set forth and\ndefined herein.\u201d\n\n  \nThis is a standard version of the University Limitations provision, but if a\nContract is high risk or there are specific, unique limitations on University\nobligations that should be identified specifically, please consult with OGC as\nto whether a more detailed University Limitations provision would be\nappropriate.  \n  \n\n####\n\n8\\. _Common Beneficial Terms._  \n\n**a._Indemnity_**. While the University may not agree to indemnify, defend, or\nhold harmless a counterparty (except for certain limited circumstances), this\nshould not discourage the University from requiring the counterparty(ies) to\nindemnify, defend, and hold harmless the University against claims and/or\nactions arising from the Contract, particularly those attributable to the acts\nor omissions of the counterparty(ies).  \n  \n**b._Insurance_**. Insurance coverage in favor of or also protecting the\nUniversity should be requested. This is usually accomplished by naming the\nUniversity as an additional insured under the applicable insurance policies\nobtained by the counterparty.  \n  \n**c._Assignment_**. The University should have the right to approve any\nassignment or other transfer of the counterparty\u2019s interest in the Contract,\nwith one of the conditions being that the counterparty is not released from\nliability under the Contract, particularly for acts, omissions, events, or\nincidents occurring prior to any assignment.\n\n  \n\n####\n\n9\\. _Confidentiality._  \nAbsent extraordinary circumstances, the University will not be able to promise\nthat the existence of a Contract or its terms can be kept confidential. The\nUniversity, like other State government entities, is subject to applicable\npublic disclosure laws, primarily Hawai\u02bbi Revised Statutes chapter 92F. There\nmay be some exceptions to the public disclosure laws that allow state\ngovernmental entities to withhold disclosure of a Contract or one or more of\nits specific terms, _e.g._ , proprietary business information. Generally,\nhowever, a copy of the fully executed Contract would be disclosable to a\nrequesting person or entity, particularly the portions pertaining to the\namounts, fees, and/or prices to be paid by the University under the Contract.\nThe University has occasionally agreed in the past to a provision under which\nneither party would proceed with a public announcement regarding the Contract\nwithout coordinating/obtaining approval of the other party prior to making\nsuch an announcement. **Appendix 10** (Sample Contract Provisions) contains a\nrecommended contractual provision covering the issue of confidentiality.  \n  \n\n**a._Proprietary business information_**. The University is subject to open\nrecords laws. A blanket assertion, without limitation as to time, that all of\nthe other party\u2019s proprietary information submitted is confidential is not\nacceptable. At a minimum, the other party should be required to clearly mark\nand designate that portion of the information submitted to the University that\nthe other party deems confidential.  \n  \n**b._Other party advised of University constraints_**. The other party should\nbe advised that the University\u2019s ability and authority to agree to express\nconfidentiality obligations is constrained, the University cannot promise\nconfidentiality, and the University will, upon receiving a disclosure request,\ndisclose or release the Contract, its terms, and such other related and\nsupporting documents that the University deems responsive to such request.  \n  \n**c._University may notify but not obtain consent_**. The other party may\nrequest that the University obtain the other party\u2019s approval before releasing\nor disclosing any confidential information. Rather than agree to obtain such\nprior consent, the University has in the past agreed to notify the other party\nof a disclosure request to allow the other party time to seek a protective\norder or take other action to restrict or prevent disclosure.  \n  \n**d._University to be protected in disclosure contest_**. The other party\nshould agree to pay for any costs the University may incur due to the other\nparty\u2019s efforts to prevent or restrict disclosure together with indemnifying\nand defending the University against any claims or actions arising from such\nefforts to prevent or restrict disclosure.\n\n  \n\n####\n\n10\\. _Data handling and security._  \nIf University data will be furnished to the other party, the University shall\nrequire that the other party have data handling, privacy, and security\npolicies in place, consistent with applicable federal and state privacy laws,\nto protect against the disclosure, release or exposure of University data,\nincluding non-public personal information.  \n  \nExecutive Policies EP 2.214 and EP 2.215 set forth data governance and\nsecurity policies applicable to the handling of University data. Obligations\nto transmit University data to the other party or to third parties must be\ncarefully reviewed, particularly if PII will be included. **Appendices 9A and\n9B** **(Data Sharing Protections and Requirements)** contains recommended\ncontractual provisions covering the data handling and security issues.  \n  \n\n####\n\n11\\. _University Representations and Warranties._  \nThe University may not agree to grant or provide warranties to others as they\nare in the nature of an indemnity and hold harmless obligation. The University\nmay make representations within the Contract provided or to the extent that a\nUniversity employee is able to confirm the accuracy of the representation\nand/or is in a position to cause the representation to be accurate or monitor\nthe University\u2019s performance with respect to that representation. The\nUniversity should limit the number and extent of any representations it is\nrequired to make.  \n  \n\n####\n\n12\\. _No Arbitration._  \nContracts usually contain proposed dispute resolution procedures that include\nnon-binding mediation and binding arbitration options. While non-binding\nmediation is acceptable, binding arbitration is not. Except in very limited\ncircumstances (such as the collective bargaining process and lease rent re-\nopenings for the use of State of Hawai\u02bbi land), the University does not\ngenerally agree to submit itself to binding arbitration. By submitting to a\nbinding arbitration process, instead of pursuing litigation in court to\nresolve a dispute, the University waives some protections that it would\notherwise be entitled to if it litigated the dispute in court.  \n  \n\n####\n\n13\\. _Attorneys' Fees._  \nContracts often contain provisions that call for the non-prevailing party in a\ndispute or legal action to pay for the other party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\nincurred in connection with the dispute or legal action. The University\nusually requests that the provision be revised to require that each party bear\ntheir own attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with any dispute,\nlegal action, or any performance under the Contract.  \n  \n\n####\n\n14\\. _Governing Law and Jurisdiction._  \nIn negotiating with other contracting parties who are based in other states\nand/or countries, there are frequent disputes over which laws govern the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the Contract terms. The laws of the State of\nHawai\u02bbi should govern. If the other contracting party declines and insists\nthat the laws of their state or country govern, the University has compromised\nin the past by proposing and agreeing to have the Contract remain silent on\nwhich laws govern.  \n  \nContracting parties based in other states and countries prefer to have their\ncourts adjudicate any legal actions involving the Contract. The University\ngenerally identifies State of Hawai\u02bbi courts as having jurisdiction over legal\nactions involving the Contract. If the other contracting party is not willing\nto subject itself to the jurisdiction of the State of Hawai\u02bbi courts, the\nUniversity has agreed to remain silent on which courts will adjudicate any\nlegal actions involving the Contract.  \n  \n\n####\n\n15\\. _Supplemental Terms and Conditions._  \nVendor contracts may try to incorporate by reference terms and conditions that\nare contained on their website, include a link to their website in the\nContract, and reserve the right to change such terms and conditions.  \n  \nIdentify and review any terms or conditions that are being incorporated into\nthe Contract but are not physically attached to or included in the body of the\nContract. These should be printed and attached to the Contract. Further, the\nother party should be required to: (a) provide the University with written\nnotification of any changes prior to the effective date of such changes\n(preferably at least 30 days) and (b) grant to the University the right to\nterminate the contract if the parties are unable to resolve any disputes\nrelating to such changes by the effective date of such changes. **Appendix\n10** (Sample Contract Provisions) contains a recommended contractual provision\ncovering this issue of supplemental terms and conditions.  \n  \n\n####\n\n16\\. _Force Majeure._  \nContracts often contain a \u201cforce majeure\u201d provision which allows either party\nto excuse, delay, or suspend performance of the Contract when their\nperformance is prevented by certain types of catastrophic events that are\nbeyond the control of the parties. **Appendix 10** (Sample Contract\nProvisions) contains a recommended force majeure provision.  \n  \n\n####\n\n17\\. _Faculty Workload._  \nSome academic and instructional contracts may affect an individual faculty\nmember\u2019s workload. In those instances, the University\u2019s collective bargaining\nagreement with University of Hawaii Professional Assembly (CBA) should be\nreviewed to ensure that the Contract is consistent with the provisions of the\nCBA. For example, the CBA (2021-2025 Unit 7 Agreement) states that, \u201c[u]sing\nthe planned professional objectives and activities of the Faculty Member, and\nthe objectives of the division or the department, the Chair and the Faculty\nMember will determine the Faculty Member's instructional workload in\naccordance with Board of Regents Policy.\u201d Art. IV.B.3. of the 2021-2025 Unit 7\nAgreement.  \n  \n\n####\n\n18\\. _Contract Modification._  \nThe University should have the right to approve any modification, alteration,\namendment, change, or extension of any term, provision, or condition of the\nContract. Further, the Contract should require that any modification,\nalteration, amendment, change, or extension of the Contract be in writing and\nsigned by all parties to the Contract.  \n  \n\n####\n\n19\\. _Compliance with Laws._  \nThe Contract should include a provision that requires the parties to a\nContract to comply with applicable laws and University rules and policies in\nconnection with the Contract. The Template Agreements include provisions\naddressing this issue. **Appendix 10** (Sample Contract Provisions) contains a\nrecommended basic contractual provision requiring compliance with applicable\nlaws for use with other Contracts, i.e., non-Template Agreements.  \n  \n\n####\n\n20\\. _Nondiscrimination Provision for Affiliation Agreements._  \nIf a Contract involves the placement of a University student in a work-based\nlearning environment with an external, non-University agency _e.g.,_\neducational fieldwork experience, internship, clinical placement, cooperative\neducational experience, the Contract should include a provision that requires\nthe parties to comply with applicable laws prohibiting discrimination. The\naffiliation agreement templates include provisions addressing this issue.\n**Appendix 10** (Sample Contract Provisions) contains a recommended basic\ncontractual provision requiring no unlawful discrimination.  \n  \n\n### **D._Execution of the Contract_**\n\n  \n\n####\n\n1\\. _Authority._  \nThe Contract should be executed by the University employee who has the\nauthority to so sign on behalf of the University. The President has the\nauthority to sign any Contract on behalf of the University. All other\nUniversity employees should be able to identify the document by which\nauthority was delegated to him/her to sign the Contract. Such delegation could\nhave been made through the President\u2019s executive policies or specific\ndelegation of authority memoranda. Delegation of authority to sign Contracts\nis described in more detail above in Section III.A.1.b. (Delegation of\nAuthority).  \n  \n\n####\n\n2\\. _Notarization._  \nSignatures on a Contract (except for certain real property-related documents)\nusually do not need to be notarized. The counterparty(ies) may prefer to have\nthe signatures notarized, particularly if such counterparty(ies) are based in\nanother state or country. The University itself might prefer that signatures\non certain contracts be notarized, _e.g._ , initial Contract with a new\nvendor, in order to confirm the identity of the persons signing on behalf of\nthe counterparty(ies). Notary assistance is available in OGC.  \n  \n\n####\n\n3\\. _Evidence of Authority to Sign._  \nConfirmation should be obtained that the person executing the Contract on\nbehalf of any counterparty is in fact or has been duly authorized by such\ncounterparty to sign the Contract. Such confirmation could be in the form of a\ndocument evidencing or verifying the authority of the signatory to bind the\ncounterparty, _e.g._ , corporate resolution or certified letter.  \n  \n\n####\n\n4\\. _Evidence of Business Registration of the Counterparty._  \nConfirmation should be obtained that the Contracting Party is a validly\nregistered business by researching the business registration where the\nbusiness was formed and/or is registered for business (for Hawai\u02bbi\nregistration _see_ State of Hawai\u02bbi Department of Commerce and Consumer\nAffairs at http://cca.hawaii.gov/breg/) and verifying the legal name of the\ncounterparty and its registered officers. Note: tradename entities do not have\nthe legal capacity to be a contracting party.  \n  \n\n  \n1Under Hawai\u02bbi law, no person may obligate the University to commitments\nbeyond that which can be met with authorized funding. _See_ Article VII,\nSection 5 of the Hawai\u02bbi State Constitution.\u21b5  \n  \n2 _See_ Hawai\u02bbi State Constitution, Art.

Purpose\n\n  1. The purpose of this policy is to (1) provide ways for supervisors to recognize and retain APT employees by increasing an employee\u2019s base salary and (2) provide guidance on other post-hire adjustments. The APT classification is unique to the University, in that job duties and responsibilities are broader and more flexible. As a result, APTs are eligible for (1) flexible initial hiring salaries, (2) base salary increases, and (3) annual, one-time performance bonuses.\n  \n\n  2. The Board of Regents has delegated the President the authority to establish and administer a salary plan for APT personnel of the University of Hawai\u2018i. See RP 9.202, Classification Plans and Compensation Schedules.\n  \n\n  3. Chancellors (UHH and UHWO), Provost and Vice Presidents shall have the authority to band and designate the Career Group for all APT positions within their organization. Community College Chancellors shall have the authority to band and designate the career group for positions in Bands A and B. See EP 9.112, Delegation of Authority for Personnel Actions.\n\n  \n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nRefer to Definitions.  \n  \n\n##  III. Salary Adjustments\n\nThe APT classification is characterized by four bands, each with a different\ndegree of job duties and responsibilities: A (trainee/independent worker), B\n(specialist/working supervisor), C (expert/manager) and D (administrator).\nWithin each band, there are multiple salary steps.See Band Concepts, APT Band\nGuidelines, and APT Salary Schedule for more information about the APT\nclassification and salaries.\n\n###\n\n  1.

The effective date shall be the date the request is officially approved by the approving authority in the HR system. An earlier effective date may be authorized by the approving authority when deemed equitable. \n  \n\n      5. An employee and/or supervisor may request an administrative review of the band action taken on the position by completing the administrative review form. \n  \n\n      6.

Purpose\n\nThe University of Hawaii (the \u201cUniversity\u201d) borrows through the issuance of\neither taxable or tax-exempt revenue bonds to finance capital projects.\nInvestors in tax-exempt revenue bonds are willing to accept a lower coupon\nbecause interest earned on tax-exempt revenue bonds is exempt from taxation.\nThis exemption translates into a lower cost of capital for the University.\nUnder federal income tax rules, various requirements must be satisfied in\norder for bonds to qualify for and maintain a tax-exempt status.  \nIn order to preserve the tax-exempt or Build America Bonds (\u201cBonds\u201d) status,\nthese policies and procedures are established to ensure that the University\ncomplies with all applicable post-issuance requirements of federal income tax\nlaw in a systematic and timely basis.  \n  \nThese policies and procedures shall apply to all applicable post-issuance\nrequirements including, without limitation, all contracts with respect to the\nuse of or use of output or throughput of tax-exempt or Build America Bonds\nrevenue bond financed assets.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. Arbitrage Rebate \u2013 Payment to the United States Treasury equal to all\ninterest earned on tax-exempt Bond proceeds in excess of the bond yield.  \n  \nB. Build America Bonds (BABs) \u2013 Taxable municipal bonds that carry special\nfederal tax credits or subsidies for either the bond holders or bond issuer.\nBABs must qualify as tax-exempt governmental bonds under section 103 of the\nInternal Revenue Code.  \n  \nC. Direct Pay Bonds \u2013 A type of tax-advantaged bond where the interest paid on\nthe Bonds is taxable to the holder and the bond issuer is allowed a refundable\ntax credit.  \n  \nD. Private Use - Use of Bond proceeds or Bond-financed property/asset by a\nnongovernmental person (individual or entity) where all or a portion of the\nasset is used in a trade or business activity.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Post-Issuance Compliance Requirements and Procedures  \n  \n1\\. External Advisors/Documentation  \n  \na. The University Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief Financial\nOfficer (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d) and other appropriate University personnel shall\nconsult with bond counsel and other legal counsel and advisors, as needed:  \n  \n(1) Throughout the bond issuance process to identify requirements and\nestablish procedures necessary or appropriate so that the Bonds will continue\nto qualify for the appropriate tax status.  \n  \n(a) Those requirements and procedures shall be documented in Tax Certificates\nand/or other documents finalized at or before issuance of the Bonds.  \n  \n(b) The requirements and procedures shall also include future compliance with\napplicable Arbitrage Rebate requirements and all other applicable post-\nissuance requirements of federal tax law throughout the term of the Bonds (and\nin some defined cases beyond the term of the Bonds).  \n  \n(2) Following issuance of the Bonds to ensure that all applicable post-\nissuance requirements are in fact met. This shall include, without limitation,\nconsultation in connection with future contracts with respect to the use of\nBond-financed assets and future contracts with respect to the use of output or\nthroughput of Bond-financed assets.  \n  \nb. Whenever necessary or appropriate, the University shall engage expert\nadvisors:  \n  \n(1) Each a \u201cRebate Service Provider\u201d to assist in the calculation of Arbitrage\nRebate payable in respect of the investment of Bond proceeds.  \n  \n(2) Each a \u201cPost-Issuance Service Provider\u201d to assist in tracking of potential\nprivate business use of the facilities financed or refinanced with proceeds\nfrom the Bonds.  \n  \n2\\. Role of the University as Bond Issuer  \n  \nUnless otherwise provided by University resolutions, unexpended Bond proceeds\nshall be held by the University and managed by the Administrator.  \n  \na. The investment of Bond proceeds must comply with Hawaii Revised Statutes\nSection 36-21, short term investment of state moneys.  \n  \nb. The University Bond System office (\u201cUBS\u201d), under the management of the\nAssociate Vice President for Budget and Finance and Controller, shall maintain\nrecords and shall provide regular, periodic statements to the University\nregarding the investments and transactions involving Bond proceeds.  \n  \nc. If a University resolution provides for Bond proceeds to be administered by\na trustee, the trustee shall provide regular, periodic (monthly) statements to\nthe University regarding the investments and transactions involving Bond\nproceeds.  \n  \n3\\. Arbitrage Rebate and Yield  \n  \nUnless the Tax Certificate specifically provides that bond counsel has advised\nthat Arbitrage Rebate(s) will not be applicable to an issue of Bonds:  \n  \na. The University shall engage the services of a Rebate Service Provider, and\nthe University or the Bond trustee shall deliver periodic statements\nconcerning the investment of Bond proceeds to the Rebate Service Provider on a\nprompt basis.  \n  \nb. Upon request, UBS shall provide to the Rebate Service Provider additional\ndocuments and information reasonably requested by the Rebate Service Provider.  \n  \nc. UBS shall monitor efforts of the Rebate Service Provider and assure payment\nof required rebate amounts, if any, no later than 60 days after each fifth\nbond year, and no later than 60 days after the last Bond of each issue is\nredeemed.  \n  \nd. During the construction period of each capital project financed in whole or\nin part by Bonds, UBS shall monitor the investment and expenditure of Bond\nproceeds and shall consult with the Rebate Service Provider to determine\ncompliance with any applicable exceptions from the Arbitrage Rebate\nrequirements during each 6-month spending period up to 6 months, 18 months, or\n24 months, as applicable, following the issue date of the Bonds.  \n  \ne. The University shall retain copies of all arbitrage reports and trustee\nstatements as described in paragraph 10d. (Record Keeping Requirements).  \n  \n4\\. Build America Bonds  \n  \nAll proceeds of Build America Bonds, other than proceeds deposited in a\nreasonably required reserve fund (see Tax Certificate), or used to pay costs\nof issuance, must be spent on capital expenditures. Such amounts include\nearnings on the original proceeds of the Build America Bonds. Capital\nexpenditures may be defined in the Tax Certificates, but generally means:  \n  \nA cost that is of a type properly chargeable to the capital account of the\nproject under general federal income tax principles. Generally, capital\nexpenditures are costs to acquire, construct, or improve property, or to adapt\nthe property to a new or different use. The property must have a useful life\nlonger than one year. Capital expenditures include design and planning costs\nrelated to the project, and include architectural, engineering, surveying,\nsoil testing, environmental, and other similar costs incurred in the process\nof acquiring, constructing, improving or adapting the property. Capital\nexpenditures do not include operating expenses of the project or incidental or\nroutine repair or maintenance of the project, even if the repair or\nmaintenance will have a useful life longer than one year. This definition of\ncapital expenditures may differ from state law definitions of capital costs or\ncapital expenditures.  \n  \n5\\. Requests for Direct Payments with Respect to the Direct Pay Bonds  \n  \na. UBS shall ensure the timely filing of a request for the federal tax credit\nfor the Build America Bonds.  \n  \nb. UBS will refer to the IRS Form 8038-G or 8038-B filed in connection with\nthe issuance of the Bonds, which sets forth the interest payable on each\ninterest payment date and the pricing numbers prepared by the underwriter or\nfinancial advisor.  \n  \nc. Requests for the federal tax credit for the Build America Bonds will be\nmade on the most recent revision of Form 8038-CP.  \n  \nd. Form 8038-CP will be filed no earlier than 90 days before the next interest\npayment date on the Bonds and no later than 45 days before the next interest\npayment date on the Bonds.  \n  \ne. UBS shall retain copies of all requests for refundable credit with respect\nto the Build America Bonds for the life of the Bonds, including any refunding\nBonds, plus three years.  \n  \n6\\. Expenditure Failures  \n  \nIf it is discovered that an Expenditure Deadline has not been met, such person\nshould promptly notify UBS who will consult with bond counsel to determine the\nappropriate course of action with respect to such unspent Bond proceeds.\nSpecial action may need to be taken with such unspent Bond proceeds, including\nyield restriction or redemption of Bonds.  \n  \n7\\. Final Allocation  \n  \na. Expenditures will be summarized in a final allocation of Bond proceeds\n(\"Final Allocation\") in a manner consistent with allocations made to determine\ncompliance with arbitrage yield restriction and rebate requirements. The Final\nAllocation will memorialize the assets or portion thereof financed with Bond\nproceeds and the assets or portion thereof financed with other funds.  \n  \nb. The Final Allocation must occur not later than 18 months after the date of\nthe expenditure or 18 months after the date the facility to which the\nexpenditure relates is completed and actually operating at substantially the\nlevel for which it was designed but in all events not later than 60 days after\nthe end of the fifth year after issuance of the Bonds or 60 days after none of\nthe Bonds are outstanding, if earlier.  \n  \n8\\. Use of Bond Proceeds  \n  \na. Bond proceeds are subject to certain Private Business Use (as hereinafter\ndefined) and Private Loan (as hereinafter defined) limitations as further\nprovided in the Tax Certificates.  \n  \n(1) Generally, the amount of Private Business Use a Bond issue may finance is\nlimited to the lesser of 10% of the Bond proceeds or $15 million. However, the\n10% Private Business Use limit is reduced to 5% to the extent that such\nPrivate Business Use is either not related or disproportionate to the\ngovernmental purpose of the issue. For this purpose, \"Private Business Use\"\ngenerally means use of the Bond-financed asset in a trade or business (e.g.,\nuse by a corporation, partnership, 501(c)(3) organization or the Federal\ngovernment). Private Business Use does not include use of the Bond-financed\nasset by the Issuer or by another state or local governmental unit or use of\nthe Bond-financed asset by the general public free of charge or pursuant to\nuniformly applied rates. Private Business Use will arise from the lease or\nsale of the Bond-financed assets. Private Business Use will generally arise\nthrough a contract whereby a non-State or local government unit manages,\noperates or provides services with respect to Bond-financed assets (a\n\"Management Contract\"). Management Contracts that meet certain requirements\nset forth in IRS Revenue Procedure 97-13 (as modified by Rev. Proc. 2001-39\nand amplified by Notice 2014-67) and Rev. Proc. 2017-13 are treated as not\ngiving rise to Private Business Use (the \"97-13 and 2017-13 Safe Harbors\").\nRev. Proc. 97-13 guidelines may be applied to a Management Contract entered\ninto before August 18, 2017 and has not been materially modified or extended\non or after August 18, 2017. Rev. Proc. 2017-13 must be applied to contracts\nentered into, materially modified or extended (including extensions under\nrenewal provisions) on or after August 18, 2017. Rev. Proc. 2017-13 may also\nbe applied to any contract entered into before August 18, 2017.  \n  \nExamples of Private Business Use relating to tax-exempt bond financed property\nmay include, but are not limited to, the following:  \n  \n(a) Leases  \n  \n(b) Management or service contracts that do not meet 97-13 and 2017-13 Safe\nHarbors  \n  \n(c) Research contracts that do not meet certain requirements described in IRS\nRevenue Procedure 2007-47  \n  \n(d) Sale or disposition of property  \n  \n(e) Naming rights arrangements  \n  \n(2) No more than the lesser of 5% or $5 million of the Bond proceeds of an\nissue may be used to make a loan (a \"Private Loan\") or loans to non-state or\nlocal governmental persons.  \n  \nb. UBS, or if applicable, a Post-Issuance Service Provider, shall:  \n  \n(1) Monitor the use of Bond proceeds, the use of Bond-financed assets (e.g.,\nfacilities, furnishings or equipment) and the use of output or throughput of\nBond-financed assets throughout the term of the Bonds (and in some cases\nbeyond the term of the Bonds) to ensure compliance with covenants and\nrestrictions set forth in applicable University resolutions and Tax\nCertificates.  \n  \n(2) Maintain records identifying the assets or portion of assets that are\nfinanced or refinanced with proceeds of each issue of Bonds.  \n  \n(3) Consult with bond counsel and other professional expert advisors in the\nreview of contracts or arrangements that may give rise to Private Business Use\ninvolving use of Bond-financed facilities.  \n  \n(4) Maintain records for any contracts or arrangements involving the use of\nBond-financed facilities as may be necessary or appropriate to document\ncompliance with all covenants and restrictions set forth in applicable\nUniversity resolutions and Tax Certificates. Such records are to be maintained\nby the individual campus departments.  \n  \n9\\. Identification and Correction of Violations  \n  \nIn the event that the use of tax-exempt bond or Build America Bond proceeds or\nBond-financed assets is different from the covenants and representations set\nforth in the Tax Certificate, the University should contact Bond Counsel in a\ntimely manner to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the tax status of\nthe Bonds. Under existing Treasury Regulations, various \u201cself-help\u201d remedies\nare available to the University in the event of certain violations of the\nlimits of use of tax-exempt bond or Build America Bond proceeds, the\ninvestment of tax-exempt bond or Build America Bond proceeds, and the use of\nthe Bond-financed assets. For example, a change in the use of the Bond-\nfinanced assets after the issuance of the Bonds that results in excessive\nPrivate Business Use may be corrected through a 'remedial action' that is\ndescribed in the Treasury Regulation Section 1.141-12. Such remedial actions\ninclude a defeasance of the portion of the Bonds affected by the excessive\nPrivate Business Use or using the disposition proceeds from the sale of the\nBond-financed assets for another qualified purpose. In the event that the\nself-help remedial actions in Treasury Regulation Section 1.141-12 are not\navailable to the University, violations occurring through University action\n(or inaction) that potentially adversely affect the status of the Bonds may be\ncorrected through the Voluntary Closing Agreement Program as further described\nin IRS Notice 2008-31 and in Sections 7.2.3 of the Internal Revenue Manual.  \n  \nAll relevant records and contracts will be maintained as described below.  \n  \n10\\. Record Keeping Requirements  \n  \nAll relevant records and contracts shall be maintained as described in this\nsection. Unless otherwise specified in applicable University resolutions or\nTax Certificates, the University shall maintain the following documents for\nthe term of each issue of Bonds (including refunding Bonds, if any) plus at\nleast three years:  \n  \na. A copy of the Bond closing transcript(s) and other relevant documentation\ndelivered to the University at or in connection with closing of the issue of\nthe Bonds.  \n  \nb. A copy of all material documents relating to capital expenditures financed\nor refinanced by Bond proceeds including, without limitation, construction\ncontracts, purchase orders, invoices, trustee requisitions and payment\nrecords, as well as documents relating to costs reimbursed with Bond proceeds\nand records identifying the assets or portion of assets that are financed or\nrefinanced with Bond proceeds.  \n  \nc. A copy of all contracts and arrangements involving Private Use of Bond-\nfinanced assets or for the Private Use of output or throughput of Bond-\nfinanced assets.  \n  \nd. Copies of all records of investments, investment agreements, arbitrage\nreports and underlying documents, including trustee statements.  \n  \nB. Tax Compliance Training  \n  \nThe Administrator or designated staff responsible for monitoring post-issuance\ncompliance matters will attend regular training or educational forums\nnecessary to stay up to date with tax-exempt bond tax requirements.  \n  \nC. Annual Review  \n  \nUBS will coordinate an annual review process to investigate, monitor, assure\nand document compliance with tax-exempt bond and Build America Bond federal\ntax law requirements.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nA. To set forth a policy to support students who have a preferred name, such\nas a Hawaiian name, an international name, or a name that is concurrent with\ntheir gender identity.  \n  \nB. The goal of this policy is to enable a consistent preferred name experience\nacross the University of Hawai\u2018i system and use of one's preferred name\nwherever legal name is not absolutely necessary.  \n  \nC. The option to use preferred name shall be available to all students as long\nas the use of the preferred name is not for the purpose of fraud or\nmisrepresentation.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. \u201cPreferred name\u201d is the name that a student uses consistently and\nregularly, other than their legal name.  \n  \nB. \u201cLegal name\u201d is the name that a student has listed as their name of record\non an official government-issued document such as birth certificate, passport,\netc.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. The University acknowledges that a preferred name may be used whenever\npossible in the course of University business and education.  \n  \nB. The University shall permit the use of a preferred name by any student who\nwishes to choose to identify themselves within the University\u2019s information\nsystems with a preferred name in addition to their legal name.  \n  \nC. It is further understood that the preferred name may be used in University\ncommunications and reporting, except where the use of the legal name is\nnecessitated by University business or legal requirement.  \n  \nD. University departments will be instructed to utilize preferred name in\ntheir business practices.  \n  \nE. This policy is limited to first names and not surnames or family names.\nThis policy may be modified, changed, altered, or rescinded at the discretion\nof the University.  \n  \nF. The University will utilize a \"Preferred Name\" that is different than a\nlegal name, upon completion of the process described below:  \n  \nG. Retrieve, complete, and sign the University Form for Use of Preferred Name.  \n  \nH. After completing the form, students must submit the form to the Office of\nthe Registrar at the home campus.  \n  \nI. The form will explain the terms and conditions under which the preferred\nname will be used. The form states where the preferred name will appear, such\nas \"on identification cards, class rosters, and directories such as Laulima\nand STAR.\"  \n  \nJ. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Office of the Vice Chancellor\nfor Student Affairs within five (5) working days of the decision. The Vice\nChancellor for Student Affairs, or designee, shall review the case and issue a\ndecision within ten (10) working days of receipt of the appeal. Appeal\ndecisions will be final and binding within the University.  \n  \nK. Students will also have access to the \u201calias\u201d feature to develop a\nhawaii.edu email address that reflects their preferred name.  \n  \nL. Students who wish to change their official name of record must submit\nofficial documentation (e.g., court order, divorce decree) directly to the\nOffice of the Registrar.  \n  \nM. The University will make every effort to display preferred first name to\nthe University community where feasible and appropriate and make a good faith\neffort to update reports, documents and systems.  \n  \nN. Legal name will still be used on certain records, including official\ntranscripts, diplomas, paychecks, payroll records, enrollment verifications,\nmedical records, financial aid documents and other records, which require use\nof an official name of record.  \n  \nO. UH reserves the right to deny or remove, with or without notice, any\npreferred name for misuse, including but not limited to fraud,\nmisrepresentation, attempting to avoid legal obligation, or the use of highly\noffensive or derogatory names.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nA. To establish a procedure to allow for the full and effective utilization of\nthe academic and non-academic resources of the University, especially so that\nstudents can meet academic program requirements within a reasonable period of\ntime.  \n  \nB. To establish guidelines and procedures under which students may enroll at\ntwo or more University of Hawai\u2018i campuses in the same semester.  \n  \nC. These guidelines and procedures shall apply to all students within the\nUniversity of Hawai\u2018i.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. \u201cConcurrent Registration\u201d means registration at a home campus, and at one\nor more other campuses of the University of Hawai\u2018i according to the\nprocedures outlined herein.  \n  \nB. \u201cConcurrent Registrant\u201d means a student who participates in concurrent\nregistration.  \n  \nC. \u201cHome Campus\u201d means the campus at which a student is pursuing a\ncertificate, a diploma, or a degree.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. Students who are enrolled at or admitted to any UH institution will be\neligible to register at any of the community colleges without having to apply\nfor admission at the other community college campuses. Students will be able\ntake non-restricted courses, at the community college campuses, for which they\nqualify (e.g., meet prerequisite, major or other requirement). Separate\napplications will be needed if students are applying to different programs at\ndifferent campuses.  \n  \nB. Students at any of the four-year UH institutions may register in\nunrestricted courses at the community colleges. Community college students may\nregister at other community colleges; however, community college students may\nnot register for courses at the four-year universities unless they have been\nformally admitted. Likewise, students at one four-year institution may not\ntake regular courses at another four-year institution, unless they have been\nformally admitted.  \n  \nC. Only the institution that is offering the course can grant registration\noverrides (special approvals) to students. For example, if a Leeward CC\nstudent desires to take a class at Windward CC that is full, an override to\nexceed the maximum enrollment must be granted by Windward CC.  \n  \n1\\. A concurrent registrant who is a recipient of financial aid must consult\nwith their home campus Financial Aid Office to determine any impact on their\nfinancial aid resulting from concurrent enrollment.  \n\n##  IV.

Acceptance of a resignation by an appointing authority does not necessarily imply that the employee resigned in \u201cgood standing.\u201d\n\n  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\n  1. Applicability/Responsibility. This procedure applies to BOR employees contemplating resigning or retiring and to the appointing authority.\n  \n\n  2. Resignation\n  \n\n    1. Notice of Resignation\n  \n\n      1. Notice of resignation for included faculty members shall be in accordance with Article XII - Tenure and Service, I. Notice of Resignation, of the bargaining unit 07 agreement.\n  \n\n      2. Notice of resignation for all other BOR appointments: Written notice of resignation should be submitted to the respective appointing authority at least fifteen (15) calendar days before the effective date of resignation. Therefore, direct supervisors who receive written notification of resignation will immediately forward the resignation to the appropriate appointing authority.\n  \n\n    2. Acceptance of Resignation\n  \n\n      1. Written notice of resignation is accepted by the appointing authority upon submission by the employee. The appointing authority should notate \u201cAcknowledged and Accepted\u201d, and date the resignation notice, prior to forwarding to the HR Representative for action and inclusion in the employee\u2019s official personnel file.\n  \n\n      2. If the appointing authority receives verbal notification of resignation from an employee, it is effective immediately. The appointing authority will provide the employee with written confirmation of the verbal resignation as soon as possible. The written confirmation may be sent by email or by U.S. mail to the employee\u2019s last known address, or it may be hand-delivered to the employee, in which case it is recommended that the employee acknowledge receipt on the file copy.\n  \n\n      3. Resignation, whether oral or written, once submitted may only be rescinded with the consent of the appointing authority.\n  \n\n    3. Resignation Submitted During an Investigation. If an employee resigns while the subject of a pending investigation pertaining to an alleged impropriety on the employee\u2019s part, the resignation may not impact the investigation. For example, options that are available for the appointing authority may include, but are not limited to:\n  \n\n      1. Discontinuing the investigation and accepting the resignation provided that the requirements of the Notice of Resignation above have been met; or\n  \n\n      2. Continuing the investigation and accepting the resignation on the condition that it may be changed to a discharge, depending upon the outcome of the investigation.\n  \n\n    4. Resignation Submitted Following Notice of Discharge. A resignation submitted following a notice of discharge may not impact the investigation. Actions that can be taken by the appointing authority may include, but are not limited to:\n  \n\n      1. Accepting the resignation provided that the effective date is on or before the effective date of the discharge; or\n  \n\n      2. Rejecting the resignation and effectuating the discharge.\n  \n\n  3. Retirement\n  \n\n    1. Notice of Retirement. A courtesy notice of retirement should be submitted to the employer preferably 2-4 weeks prior to the effective date in order to assist the employer in ensuring that operations are efficiently and effectively continued.\n  \n\n    2. Filing for Retirement. An employee planning to retire must   \ncontact the Employees\u2019 Retirement System (ERS) to complete and file the\nnecessary documents for retirement in accordance with ERS policies and\nprocedures.\n\n  \n\n  4. Return Service Obligations\n  \n\n    1. Appointing authorities authorized to accept resignations and retirements are required to confirm that the employee has fulfilled any return service obligations following a sabbatical leave or paid professional improvement leave. Should there be any obligation outstanding, the employee shall be notified in writing of the outstanding obligation and the consequences of resignation or retirement, i.e., repayment of salary received during the sabbatical or paid professional improvement leave period.\n  \n\n    2. If the employee with an outstanding obligation decides to resign or retire, the appointing authority shall ensure that collection action is initiated in accordance with section 78-12, Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes, and Administrative Procedure AP 8.877, Salary and Wage Overpayment Recovery.\n\n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nTo provide a procedure to ensure system-wide consistency in the naming and\nassigning of program codes for academic programs and to adhere to national\nstandards in data reporting in order to comply with RP 5.201 and EP 5.201.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n  1. Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP): A taxonomic scheme that supports the accurate tracking and reporting of fields of study and program completion activity developed and maintained by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics. The CIP consists of a CIP code, CIP title, and CIP description.\n  \n\n  2. CIP Code: The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code associated with the Official Program Name that is designated prior to Board of Regents (BOR) approval.\n  \n\n  3. CIP Title: The academic program title connected to the designated federal CIP code. This title is taken from the federal CIP database and may differ slightly from the BOR-approved Official Program Name.\n  \n\n  4. CIP Description: The brief narrative provided by the National Center for Education Statistics that is attached to each individual CIP code.\n  \n\n  5. Official Program Name: The name of the program, including parenthetical information, approved by the Board of Regents at the provisional program stage. It is the official name for purposes of the Board of Regents-conferred credentials and is used in University publications.\n  \n\n  6. Program Code Request (PCR): Includes a request for the program name and program code (consisting of the degree type, major name and major code), CIP Code, effective term, curriculum, required documentation, and approvals.\n  \n\n  7. Student Data Oversight Committee (SDOC): A Data Governance Committee subcommittee focused on improving data quality and access as well as providing guidance on future directions, priorities, and uses of student Institutional Data Systems. The SDOC has the authority to make decisions on student data issues and make recommendations to the Data Governance Committee on policies and principles related to data management and use (EP 2.215 Institutional Data Governance). SDOC manages the principles for program name, program description, and the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), and code assignment.\n  \n\n  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\n  1. The CIP policy adheres to the following basic principles, is further clarified in the SDOC Program Code Policies:  \n\n    1. National alignment:  \n\n      1. The program name and CIP code should align with the national database of CIP codes.\n  \n\n      2. The program curriculum alignment to the national definition is the defining factor in choosing a CIP code.\n  \n\n      3. The program name, contents and conferred degree should be in alignment for students\u2019 understanding.\n  \n\n      4. A significant change to a program will generate a new program code and require President\u2019s approval. A change in CIP code, program name or substantial modification of the curriculum would be a significant change. A non-significant change would be an industry-wide or institution-wide change to remain current with terminology or federally mandated CIP code changes.\n  \n\n    2. UH System alignment:  \n\n      1. If a similar program exists or uses the same Official Program Name in the UH System, then the same CIP classification shall be used.\n  \n\n      2. If the program name or CIP code is already in use within the UH System, the party proposing a CIP code for a substantially different program may not use the same code.\n  \n\n      3. The Official Program Name, content, and conferred degree (if applicable) should align to ensure coherency with students\u2019 understanding of the credential and the program learning outcomes.\n  \n\n      4. The Official Program Name, the assigned program code, and CIP code shall be the same in all public documents.\n  \n\n    3. In the event the CIP classification and Official Program Name do not align, supplementary documentation for consideration may include recommendation/guidance from an applicable federal agency or accrediting body; peer institution CIP classification for similar programs; and/or applicable and citable non-industry/trade-specific higher education publications such as _The Chronicle of Higher Education._\n  \n\n  2. Requesting a CIP Code for a New Program.   \n  \nThe approval of a CIP code for a new program shall go through the relevant\ncampus approval process before the request is forwarded to the Institutional\nResearch, Analysis and Planning Office (IRAPO).  \n  \nThe steps are as follows:  \n\n    1. A campus seeking to develop a new program shall notify IRAPO regarding the need for a CIP code when submitting the provisional program proposal.\n  \n\n    2. The campus completes a \u201cProgram Code Request (PCR) - New\u201d form and indicates the CIP code in the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section.  \n\n      1. UH Community College campuses shall submit requests through the Office of the Vice President for Community Colleges (OVPCC).\n  \n\n      2. Four-year campuses may submit requests directly to IRAPO.\n  \n\n    3. Based on the campus\u2019s PCR, IRAPO reviews the proposed Program Name and requested CIP code and CIP title while consulting with campuses as needed.\n  \n\n    4. The request is reviewed for recommendation by the Council of Chief Academic Officers (CCAO), SDOC, the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy (OVPAS) or the OVPCC.\n  \n\n    5. The OVPAS endorses the Authorization to Plan (ATP) request.\n  \n\n    6. IRAPO approves the PCR and the campus\u2019s requested CIP code after consultation with the campus if needed. For advanced degrees, IRAPO will approve the CIP code based upon the recommendation of the Chancellor/Provost.\n  \n\n    7. IRAPO coordinates the implementation of the new program addition into the student information systems (Banner and DAPIR/ODS) after the CIP code for the new program has been approved.\n  \n\n  3. Requesting a Change in Program Name, Program Code, or CIP Code  \n\n    1. Requests involving significant change: Name/Code/CIP changes that reflect a significant program change are handled according to the requirements for new program authorizations as outlined in EP 5.201.  \n\n      1. When making significant changes, because the CIP code is the primary means of federal program reporting (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System--IPEDS), the source used by college selection organizations (e.g., College Navigator, College Board), and because changes may impact financial aid and student visas, the implications of the program\u2019s CIP code assignment should be taken into consideration.\n  \n\n      2. The Program Request Process is as follows:  \n\n        1. The campus submits a completed \u201cProgram Code Request (PCR) \u2013 Modification\u201d form with the CIP code in the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section.\n  \n\n        2. If the modified program name, program code, or CIP code is used by other programs in the UH System, approval must be obtained from all affected parties by the requesting campus.\n  \n\n        3. IRAPO reviews the program request for compliance with applicable Regents Policies and Executive Policies and requests modifications, if needed.\n  \n\n        4. For advanced degrees, IRAPO will approve based upon the recommendation of the Chancellor/Provost.\n  \n\n        5. The request is reviewed for recommendation by SDOC and either the OVPAS or OVPCC.\n  \n\n        6. IRAPO then coordinates the implementation of the campus\u2019s change(s) in the student information systems (Banner and DAPIR/ODS) and validates correctness.\n  \n\n    2. Requests involving non-significant change: Requests to change a program name to remain current in terminology but not entailing any significant change in the program are made to the President. IRAPO then coordinates the implementation of the campus\u2019s change(s) in the student information systems (Banner and DAPIR/ODS) and validates correctness. Maintaining currency in terminology means:  \n\n      1. A substantial number of a campus\u2019 peer and benchmark institutions have adopted the program name change or \n  \n\n      2. The change follows the recommendation/guidance from an applicable federal agency, accrediting body, and/or industry consortium.\n  \n\n  4. If policy-related changes are made to the CIP process, these changes will be introduced by the OVPAS in conjunction with the OVPCC; IRAPO; Provost/Chancellors of impacted campuses; and reviewed by the SDOC and/or CCAO.\n\n  \n  \n**Applicable University Policies**  \n\n  1.

Explaining the rate proposal to affected students (electronic media may be used to assist with this process); and   \n  \n\n      2. Affording affected students and other interested parties the opportunity to provide input on the rate proposal. Members of the campus administration shall be present to respond to questions and receive input.\n  \n  \n\n    5. The campus vice chancellor for student affairs reviews comments and testimony received on the rate proposal, provides the vice chancellor for administration and chancellor with a summary of the feedback collected at the open public meetings, and recommends any revisions to the rate proposal as appropriate.  \n  \n\n    6. A final rate proposal should be presented to the campus chancellor for approval no later than thirty (30) days before the end of the semester preceding the semester in which the proposed rates would apply. The chancellor may approve the proposal, modify it, or reject it.   \n  \n\n    7. Posting of approved new rates on the appropriate student housing websites should occur no later than the last day of the semester preceding the semester in which the approved rate applies, and optimally by March 1 for Fall semester increases.

Purpose\n\nA. To define the parameters of a program with low number of\ndegrees/certificates of achievement conferred.  \n  \nB. To describe the actions required when a program with low number of\ndegrees/certificates of achievement conferred falls within the defined\nparameters.  \n  \nC. To identify the parties responsible to implement the policy.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. A program is any sequence of courses or instructional activities that\nculminate in a Board conferred degree or certificate of achievement.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nA. The Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy will\nprovide an annual reporting to the Board of Regents of programs with low\nnumber of degrees/certificates of achievement programs conferred.  \n  \nB. Parameter for programs with low number of degrees conferred:  \n  \n1\\. Fewer than 10 undergraduate degrees/certificates of achievement conferred\nper year (three year average)  \n  \n2\\. Three or fewer graduate degrees conferred per year (5 year average)  \n  \nC. A program with low number of degrees/certificates of achievement conferred\nwill prompt a campus level review that will:  \n  \n1\\. Address the program quality.  \n  \na. Articulate how the academic program is aligned with the strategic\ndirections of the campus and system goals. What evidence is there that the\nprogram - even if small - fills a genuine student, programmatic, and/or\ncommunity or workforce need?  \n  \nb. Articulate how the program represents an area unique to UH, or important to\nthe university\u2019s mission, reputation, strategic goals, identity, or otherwise\nfurthers the state\u2019s economic goals.  \n  \nc. Is the program well managed and of strong quality?  \n  \n(1). Common quality indicators include but may not be limited to time-to-\ndegree, graduation rates, and quality of student work while in the program and\ngraduate school enrollment and employment post graduate rates.  \n  \n(2). What is the trend in enrollment of majors? What options are there to\nincrease the number of majors?  \n  \n2\\. Address the program costs.  \n  \na. Are the costs of the program appropriately aligned with the needs, mission,\nand strategic goals of the campus and system?  \n  \nb. If the program were discontinued as a major, what faculty or staff\nresources would become available for use in other areas?  \n  \n3\\. Address significant overlap or redundancy with existing similar programs\non the campus and within the UH system.  \n  \na. In what ways is this program similar to or redundant with other programs on\nthe campus and within the UH System?  \n  \nb. Are there benefits to reconfiguring this program?  \n  \nD. The campus review will result in one of the following recommendations:  \n  \n1\\. Continuation of the program.  \n  \na. If a program with low number of degrees/certificates of achievement\nconferred is continued, its progress and status will be reviewed annually\nunless it is determined to have no significant unique costs or to be uniquely\nand solidly aligned with the function, mission, strategic goals of the campus\nand/or UH system, and in some instances, specific state goals.  \n  \n(1). The review team may be asked to provide recommendations of how to\nstrengthen the program and make it more viable, or more strategically aligned\nwith campus and system priorities.  \n  \n(2). The responsible department/division may be asked to develop a concrete\naction plan to move the program off this status by increasing the number of\ndegrees/certificates of achievement. The Chancellor or designee will approve\nthis plan.  \n  \n2\\. Given the evaluation of the program, it may be required that such a\nprogram will meet the minimum criteria for number of degrees conferred by the\ntime of the next comprehensive program review. If it has not, it should be\nexpected that a recommendation to terminate or merge the program will emerge\nduring the next review cycle.  \n  \n3\\. Merging the program into an appropriate larger degree program, or merging\nseveral low-enrollment programs into a single, more inclusive program within\nthe School, College or campus.  \n  \n4\\. Stopping-out admission and terminating the program. It may be possible to\ncontinue to provide access for individual students through other means, e.g.,\nInterdisciplinary Studies.  \n  \n5\\. It may also be possible to redirect interested students to programs at\nanother campus.  \n  \nE. In the event that a program with low number degrees/certificates of\nachievement conferred is found to be appropriately positioned within the\ninstitution based on the mission, strategic goals, reputation, or identity,\nthe regularly scheduled program reviews should continue to address the\nquestions above.  \n\n##  IV.

The BOR, by authority of Section 304A-103, Hawai`i Revised Statutes, can\nacquire both real and personal property and can hold, maintain, use, operate,\nsell, lease, and retire of same whenever appropriate.  \n  \n3\\. The University, notwithstanding the authority of the BOR, is accountable\nfor all  \ncapital assets acquired and retired during the year since the inventory\nrecorded as of  \nthe last preceding July 1. Chapter 103D, Hawai\u02bbi Revised Statutes, requires\nthe University to submit a detailed accounting certificate to the State\nComptroller annually on or before September 15.  \n  \n4\\. The University President, Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief\nFinancial  \nOfficer, and the Director of Financial Management and Controller, have\nredelegated the responsibility for the management and control of inventorial\nproperty to the Director of PFMO.  \n  \n5\\.

The Director shall provide for maximum use of\nall property.  \n  \n6\\. Department heads, directors, PIs, asset representatives, or fiscal\nadministrators  \nare delegated as responsible custodians when assigned property account(s).\nAsset representatives have responsibility for direct control, use, care,\nmaintenance, and safekeeping of all property for their respective departments\nor units. Further, they shall maintain and control the physical location,\naccount records, and assure the security of the property to accurately support\nthe University\u2019s centralized inventory accounting records. The asset\nrepresentative is responsible for ensuring that reasonable security measures\nhave been implemented to prevent theft, damage or misuse of equipment and\ncontrolled property.  \n  \n7\\. During the absence of an asset representative, the responsibility for the\ncontrol,  \nmaintenance and custody of the University, federal and agency owned property\nrests with the department head or director for the unit which acquired the\nproperty. Such responsibility includes property acquired for use on an\nextramurally funded project by a PI during the project or thereafter until the\nproject has been satisfactorily closed out. Department heads or directors,\nhowever, may assign administrative functions to department staff personnel to\naccomplish the custodial responsibilities which include, but are not limited\nto:  \n  \na. Identification and location of all inventorial University or sponsor owned\nproperty purchased for, or assigned to, their respective departments;  \n  \nb. Receiving and inspecting delivered goods and processing the payment for\nsuch goods in a timely manner;  \n  \nc.

Applicability/Responsibilities\n\nThis administrative procedure applies to the recruitment and selection of the\nbest qualified for all faculty and APT positions regardless of funding source.  \n  \nIt does not apply to casual appointments which are covered under\nAdministrative Procedure A9.480, Casual Appointments; graduate assistants\nwhich are covered under Administrative Procedure A9.550, Appointment of\nGraduate Assistants; and lecturers, cooperating teachers, counselors which are\ncovered under Administrative Procedure A9.560, Appointment of Lecturers and\nCooperating Teachers/Counselors.  \n  \nThe President, Chief Executive Campus Officers or their official designees,\nState Director for Career and Technical Education, and M\u0101noa Deans and\nDirectors are responsible for ensuring that appointment recommendations have\nbeen reviewed for conformance with this procedure and other appropriate\npolicies and procedures and are supported by sound human resources management\npractices.  \n  \n\n##  IV. Procedures\n\n  1. Recruitment Procedures  \n  \nFor each position vacancy, the department or other hiring unit shall:  \n  \n\n    1. Refer to Administrative Procedure, A9.485, Filling of Vacant Positions, for specific procedures and forms to be completed; UH Form 18 (EEO/AA) Suggested Checklist for Recruitment/Hiring Process (Attachment 1).  \n  \n\n    2. Review the position description (for APT positions) for accuracy, and, as appropriate, update to ensure currency of work assignment and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  \n  \nRequests for establishment of new APT positions or updating of existing APT\npositions with significant changes in the duties must be submitted to the\nChancellor\u2019s designee or the University Office of Human Resources (OHR), as\nappropriate, for action under the procedures established by Administrative\nProcedure A9.210, Classification and Compensation Plan for APT Personnel.  \n\n    3. Analyze work force for underutilization. Before initiating recruitment, the Dean/Director/Provost or official designee shall refer to the current Affirmative Action Plan or contact the Director of EEO/AA (M\u0101noa and System units), the Campus EEO/AA Coordinator (Hilo/West O\u2018ahu), or the CC Director of EEO/AA (Community Colleges) to determine if there is underutilization in the job group for which recruitment is to be carried out.  \n  \n\n    4. Conduct affirmative action/recruitment. If there are underrepresented groups, affirmative recruitment efforts should be made in addition to the minimum advertising specified in IV.C., Vacancy Announcement Procedures, below. Contact the Director of EEO/AA (M\u0101noa and System units), the Campus EEO/AA Coordinator (Hilo/West O\u2018ahu), or the CC Director of EEO/AA (Community Colleges) for more information on affirmative recruitment. Examples of affirmative recruitment efforts may include:  \n\n      1. Specifying a longer recruitment period to encourage a broader applicant pool.  \n\n      2. Including members of underrepresented groups on committees for recruitment, screening, interviewing and selection.  \n\n      3. Encouraging members of underrepresented groups to apply for higher-level positions.  \n\n      4. Sending copies of advertisements to organizations which may bring the available positions to the attention of minorities, as identified by the underutilization analysis.  \n\n  \n\n    5.

Applicants should be referred to the respective campus security office and/or informed of the campus web page for such information.  \n  \n\n    6. Faculty positions that were advertised and filled on a temporary or non-tenurial basis, must be re-advertised and a competitive search conducted if they are to be filled on a tenure- track basis, unless otherwise specified.  \n\n  \n\n  2. Unsolicited Resumes  \n  \nColleges/Departments may retain unsolicited resumes. However, if retained, the\nresumes must be evaluated and considered whenever appropriate vacancies occur.\nIf not retained, the unsolicited resumes should either be returned to the\nindividuals, or the individuals should be notified that consideration for a\nUniversity position requires an application for the specific advertised\nposition in accordance with advertised application requirements.  \n  \n\n  3. Vacancy Announcement Procedures  \n  \nThe appropriate Chief Executive Campus Officers or their official designees,\nState Director for Career and Technical Education, or M\u0101noa Deans and\nDirectors shall review the recruitment sources.  \n  \nAll pertinent aspects of the position must be advertised.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policy on shared governance in academic decision-making and\nacademic policy development.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. Introduction  \n  \n1\\. With unanimous agreement and understanding that the faculty of an\neducational institution contributes to its quality, spirit, aspiration, and\neffectiveness, the board issues this policy to provide for organized faculty\ninvolvement in the development and maintenance of a collegial approach to\nacademic decision-making and policy development. The role of a university\nfaculty governance organization is to advise the administration (primarily at\nthe campus and unit level) on matters impacting and/or relating to the\ndevelopment and maintenance of academic policy and standards to the end that\nquality education is provided, preserved, and improved.  \n  \n2\\. The board has the ultimate responsibility for the governance of the\nuniversity and the formulation of policies which guide and determine its\naffairs. In carrying out these ultimate responsibilities, the board entrusts\nand delegates various functions to members of the university community and\nvarious organizational units. Unless specifically delegated or entrusted to\nothers, all governing authority resides with the board.  \n  \n3\\. The president is the chief executive officer of the board and the\nuniversity, and has primary responsibility for recommending and implementing\nboard policies. The interpretation of board policies, however, shall rest\nexclusively with the board.  \n  \n4\\. The chancellors have the leadership responsibility for the immediate\noperational management and governance of their respective organizational units\nwithin board governing and presidential administrative policies.  \n  \nB. Faculty Involvement in Academic Decision-Making and Academic Policy\nDevelopment  \n  \n1\\. It is the policy of the university to maintain and strengthen organized\nand systematic involvement by faculty in academic decision-making and policy\ndevelopment. Consistent with this policy, the faculties of the University of\nHawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa, the University of Hawai\u2018i at Hilo, the University of Hawai\u2018i\nat West O\u2018ahu, and the Community Colleges are authorized to develop faculty\norganizations by which regular and organized faculty involvement may be\nexercised in carrying out their collective responsibilities with their\nadministrative colleagues in matters of academic policy for the particular\ncampus, major organizational unit headed by a chancellor, and the university,\nand to make such determinations as set forth herein below.  \n  \n2\\. While the primary focus of this responsibility is at the campus level,\ninvolvement in university-wide academic policy through normal administrative\nchannels is also important in protecting and strengthening the quality of the\nuniversity.  \n  \n3\\. The following further describes details of this policy.  \n  \na. Together with and subject to the approval of its chancellor, each campus\nfaculty may:  \n  \n(1) Determine its own organization consistent with this policy and any other\napplicable university and/or board policies, bylaws, and procedures; and  \n  \n(2) Adopt its own bylaws and rules of procedure for exercising the role and\nperforming the duties outlined in this policy. Once such organization or\norganizations and charters are approved, the pattern of participation in\ncampus and university matters will be realized in accordance with the\ncharters.  \n  \nb. The duly authorized organization specified by each charter shall have the\nresponsibility to speak for the faculty on academic policy matters such as:  \n  \n(1) Determining the initiation, review, and evaluation of proposed,\nprobationary, or authorized research, instructional, and academic programs;  \n  \n(2) Budget planning and implementation;  \n  \n(3) Student-faculty relations;  \n  \n(4) Evaluation of faculty and campus academic administrators;  \n  \n(5) Establishing a canon of professional ethics and an effective means of\nprofessional maintenance of those ethics, including faculty self-discipline;\nand  \n  \n(6) Other subjects referred to it or them by the chancellor, or by request of\nthe appropriate faculty organization.  \n  \nc. As stated previously by the board, the faculty has primary responsibility\nfor such fundamental academic areas as curriculum content, subject matter, and\nmethods of instruction and research. On these matters the power of review and\nconcurrence or final decision lodged in the board or delegated to\nadministration officers should be exercised adversely only in exceptional\ncircumstances and for reasons communicated to the faculty.  \n  \nd. In cases of academic policy proposals that may be initiated by the board or\nrecommended by the president, the president shall decide the manner by which\nthe advice and full input of duly constituted faculty organizations are\nobtained. Prior to final board action, such advice, along with the president\u2019s\nrecommendations, will be considered.  \n  \ne. The role of the faculty as set forth herein shall not be delegated to any\nother entity by the faculty organization established pursuant to this policy.  \n  \nf. Each action of the faculty under these provisions shall be consistent with\nsuch policy and directives as the board may prescribe. If there is any\nconflict, the chancellor shall notify the faculty of the conflict and initiate\nconsultation to resolve the problem.  \n  \n4\\. The authority for implementing this policy is vested in the president of\nthe university or his/her designee. Each campus is encouraged to develop and\nsubmit for approval a system of faculty involvement in academic decision-\nmaking and policy development in accordance with this policy.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe board entrusts and delegates various functions to members of the\nuniversity community and various organizational units. Unless specifically\ndelegated or entrusted to others, all governing authority resides with the\nboard.  \n  \nThe authority for implementing this policy is vested in the president of the\nuniversity or his/her designee.  \n\n##  V.

Definitions\n\n\u201cRIO\u201d means a student organization, association or club that has been formed\nto meet special interests of certain groups of students on campus.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. General Provisions  \n  \n1\\. The university\u2019s educational environment for students and the campus\ncommunity may be enhanced by an RIO which provides educational, social,\ncultural, recreational, governance, religious or communication activities.  \n  \n2\\. A RIO refers to a student organization, association or club that has been\nformed to meet special interests of certain groups of students on campus. The\nconstitution or charter of the RIO must be adopted or ratified by members of\nthe RIO but is not subject to the approval of the university. The RIO is not\ndirectly supported financially through mandatory student activity fees.\nHowever, they may request financial assistance from a CSO\u2019s funding assistance\nprogram developed by the CSO.  \n  \n3\\. A RIO must register with the campus in which it will exist. Each campus\nshall develop policies applicable to the RIO. Such policies shall be subject\nto the approval of the chancellor. The chancellor may further delegate his/her\nauthority to approve the RIO policy to the appropriate senior student affairs\nofficer of the campus.  \n  \nB. Relationship of an RIO to the University  \n  \n1\\. An RIO, like a CSO, is not an agency of the university. RIO, unlike the\nCSO, is not involved in the governance process and does not represent or serve\nthe entire student body on their campus.  \n  \n2\\. The university assumes no responsibility for the activities of an RIO. An\nRIO must fully inform its members and the public of its relationship to the\nuniversity by including the following disclaimer in its publications and\ncommunication with third parties: \u201cAlthough the registered organization has\nmembers who are university students, the registered organization is\nindependent of the university and does not represent the views of the\nuniversity. The registered organization is responsible for its own contracts,\nacts, or omissions.\u201d  \n  \n3\\. An RIO\u2019s leaders shall assume full responsibility for the organization\u2019s\nactivities and conduct of its members. As benefits for university\nregistration, staff resource liaisons may be provided by its campus to answer\nfurther questions regarding the relationships of the RIO to the university\ncampus and to offer educational assistance services that support the effective\nfunctioning of the RIO.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nEach campus shall develop policies applicable to the RIO, subject to the\napproval of the chancellor. The chancellor may further delegate his/her\nauthority to approve the RIO policy to the appropriate senior student affairs\nofficer of the campus. See RP 7.203(A)(3).  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policy regarding the rules of conduct and communication protocol.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n\u201cGovernment\u201d may be thought of as the establishment of the principles, laws\nand policies, and \u201cadministration\u201d as the carrying out and execution of these\nprinciples, laws and policies once approved by the board.  \n  \nThe term \u201cthrough proper channels\u201d refers to the obligation of the board\nmembers to secure detailed information or information requiring careful\ncompilation, either through the secretary or through the executive officer.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. Principles and Rules of Conduct.  \n  \n1\\. Principles. With respect to the duties and functions of the board and the\npresident, the following are the applicable principles:  \n  \na. It is recognized that the board has been granted full legal power and\nauthority to manage and control the affairs of the university, and the\nresponsibility for the successful operation of the university and the\nachievement of the purposes as prescribed in the statutes rests exclusively\nwith the board.  \n  \nb. It is recognized that a distinction must be made between what may, for\nconvenience, be called the \u201cgovernment\u201d of the university, and the\n\u201cadministration\u201d thereof. \u201cGovernment\u201d may be thought of as the establishment\nof the principles, laws and policies, and \u201cadministration\u201d as the carrying out\nand execution of these principles, laws and policies once approved by the\nboard. Therefore, the interpretation of all board policies shall rest\nexclusively with the board and may be rendered, as necessary, through its\ndesignee(s).  \n  \nc. The functions of the board are concerned with the government of the\nuniversity; and its duties, in nature, are legislative and at times quasi-\njudicial. The execution of the policies authorized and established by the\nboard is entrusted to the president, vice presidents, chancellors, and other\nofficers of administration of the university. The regents must not concern\nthemselves directly with the administration of the university, or individually\nor take part collectively, in administration, provided that it is the\nresponsibility of the board to satisfy itself, through proper channels, that\nthe principles, laws and policies established by the board are, in fact, being\nadministered and that the administration is adequate.  \n  \nThe term \u201cthrough proper channels\u201d refers to the obligation of the board\nmembers to secure detailed information or information requiring careful\ncompilation, either through the secretary or through the executive officer. It\nis not intended to place any restriction upon members of the board conversing\nfreely and frankly with any officers or other employees of the university. Any\nextended or detailed investigation or inquiry on the basis of which it is\nproposed to predicate board action should, however, be carried on in a formal,\norderly manner with the approval of the board and the knowledge of the\npresident. Ordinarily where assistance is sought of the faculty in major\nmatters of educational policy, the board will act through the president; and\nsuch assistance will come through the relevant academic senate for the\naffected campus(es) or some committee thereof.  \n  \nLikewise, the administration shall communicate with the board through the\nsecretary and only with permission of the chairperson may the administration\ndeal directly with a member of the board. This is to ensure that all regents\nhave equal access to information and are given equal regard for their time and\ncontributions.  \nd. No member of the board shall serve on committees of the university\nconcerned with curriculum and educational problems when a matter is to\neventually require the board\u2019s consideration, nor on any selection committees.  \n  \ne. The primary duty of the board is first to determine and set forth the\nobjectives of the university, and second, to provide the means, in the form of\nadequate budget, personnel and materials, to achieve these objectives. In\ndetermining the objectives of the university, the assistance of the faculty\nwill be sought and obtained through proper channels.  \n  \n2\\. Rules of Conduct. The rules of conduct between members of the board and\nadministration personnel shall be as follows:  \n  \na. In carrying out any policy established by the board, except in so far as\nthe method shall be defined by the board, the method of execution shall be\nwithin the discretion of the president.  \n  \nb. Except as specifically authorized by formal action, no member of the board\ncan represent the board within the university and no member shall interfere,\nengage in, or interact directly with the campuses without prior authorization\nfrom the chairperson. All meetings between board members and any member of the\nadministration, including the president, shall be authorized by the board\u2019s\nchairperson and arranged through the secretary and/or with the full knowledge\nof the secretary. In addition, no unilateral action of a member of the board\nhas the authorization nor support of the board; and the authority of the board\nreposes in the board as a whole. Likewise, all communication from the\npresident and any members of the administration to the members of the board\nmust flow through the secretary unless otherwise authorized.  \n  \nc. The board members shall make written request through the secretary for any\ndetailed information with reference to actions of the president, particularly\nwhere it is desired to challenge such actions as inconsistent with the\nestablished policy of the board.  \n  \nd. The interpretation of all board policies rests exclusively with the board.\nWhere no policy has been established by the board, the president shall consult\nwith the board prior to taking action; however, the president shall be free to\nexercise his/her judgment in taking action on emergency matters of major\nimportance provided that in consultation with the chairperson, it is\ndetermined that a special meeting of the board cannot be held in time to\naddress the emergency. Therefore, every attempt shall be made to have the\nboard convened in special session as soon as possible. The president shall\ninform the chairperson of such circumstances, advising him/her prior to taking\nany action(s) where board policy is silent.  \n  \ne. The president shall, by appropriate memoranda either to the secretary or by\ninformation circulated to all board members, promptly advise board members as\nto how specific orders of the board have been carried out.  \n  \nf. The determination of what correspondence of the president, if any, shall be\nsent to the board for its files shall rest in the sole discretion of the\npresident unless the board, by appropriate action, shall otherwise direct.  \ng. These rules may be amended from time to time by action of the board.  \n  \nB. Procedures Relating to Communication to and from the Board and its Members  \n  \n1\\. All communications involving advice, recommendations, instructions, etc.,\nwritten or oral, from any board member individually or as a representative of\na board committee, shall first receive the approval of the chairperson and\nthereafter be transmitted through the executive officer. This action does not\npreclude discussion or exchange of opinion or similar dealings between board\nmembers and staff members. All formal inquiries shall be made through the\nsecretary and all meetings between board members and other members and members\nof the administration shall be arranged through and/or with the full knowledge\nof the secretary, with such meetings subject to Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes\nChapter 92 (sunshine laws).  \n  \n2\\. Communications and notifications emanating from official board action and\nrelating to specifically or generally to university affairs, internal or\nexternal, instructional and administrative, should be transmitted through the\nexecutive officer. Whenever legally necessary, or in cases specific by the\nboard, communications and notifications emanating from board action shall be\nhandled by the secretary.  \n  \n3\\. Correspondence addressed to the board or to the secretary or to the\nuniversity shall go to that officer under whose jurisdiction the\ncorrespondence shall be handled. A certain latitude of judgment in matters of\ncorrespondence is granted to the secretary. The work of the secretary and of\nthe executive officer should be coordinated through mutual agreement.  \n  \n4\\. Shortly after each meeting of the board, the secretary shall furnish the\nexecutive officer with an abstract of board action in order that the executive\nofficer may handle correspondence as soon as possible and involve the\nappropriate units for publicity.  \n  \n5\\. Copies of all board related correspondence handled by the executive\nofficer shall be filed with the secretary in the office of the regents and,\nlikewise, copies of all board related correspondence handled by the secretary\nshall be sent to the executive officer.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe execution of the policies authorized and established by the board is\nentrusted to the president, vice presidents, chancellors, and other officers\nof administration of the university.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nThis procedure recognizes Board of Regents Policy (\u201cRP\u201d) 12.207  \n  \nThis procedure redirects the policy and procedure for federally funded\npurchases to Regents Policy (RP) 12.207 and Administrative Procedure (AP)\n12.203, which identifies the Office of Research Services (ORS) and the\nResearch Corporation of the University of Hawaii (RCUH) as providing fiscal\nand administrative services, including but not limited to, the procurement of\ngoods, services, and construction, for extramurally sponsored research and\ntraining projects, including those sponsored by federal contracts and grants.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nExtramural contracts and grants refer to external sponsorship of research,\ntraining, or other activities such as a federally funded grant or contract.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\n  1. Pursuant to RP 12.207 and AP 12.203, RCUH provides fiscal and administrative services to the University for the University\u2019s extramural contracts and grants with federal sponsors.

Split Funded Purchases. Split funded procurements involving a federally sponsored research or training account and a University non-federal fund account shall be processed as a University procurement action through the University financial system. The federal rules and regulations, as addressed in RCUH policies and procedures, would still apply to these split funded procurements. Purchases intended for the support of federally funded contracts and grants shall not be supplemented with funds from a University non-federal fund account for the primary purpose of creating a split-funded purchase in order to evade processing through ORS and RCUH.\n  \n\n  3.

Purpose\n\nTo provide eligible University of Hawai\u2018i (University) Civil Service\nemployees, who are unable to return to their usual and customary duties due to\nwork-related injury or illness, an opportunity for temporary duty, or\nplacement via alternate work to another suitable position. This provision is\nconsistent with the Governor\u2019s Administrative Directive No. 94-02, \u201cOn\nReturning Injured and Disabled Employees to Work.\u201d  \n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n_Alternate work_ : Work in a position other than the employee\u2019s current\nposition to which the employee with a disability is assigned when the employee\ncan no longer perform the usual and customary duties and responsibilities of\nhis or her pre-injury/illness work.  \n  \n_Civil Service employees (employees)_ : Includes employees that have met\nrequirements for membership in the Civil Service as defined in the State of\nHawai\u2018i Department of Human Resources Development Policies and Procedures\nPolicy No. 300.001 (\u201cTypes of Appointments\u201d), and have passed an initial\nprobation period. Non-Civil Service emergency or exempt hires are not eligible\nunder this policy.  \n  \n_Claims Manager_ : Office responsible for reviewing compensable Workers\u2019\nCompensation (WC) claims and validating workers\u2019 compensation applicability.  \n  \n_Eligibility period_ : A period not to exceed six months. The eligibility\nperiod begins with the initial employee informational meeting and runs\nconcurrently with the initial 30 calendar days to review options. It ends with\na placement or the completion of one University-wide job search within the\nsix-month period.  \n  \n_Human Resources Representative (HR Rep)_ : Human Resources Representative\nassigned to the employee\u2019s hiring unit.  \n  \n_Light work_ : Temporary work that is different from the employee\u2019s usual and\ncustomary duties and responsibilities to which the employee may be temporarily\nassigned if such work is available and the work is planned or assigned to\nadhere to the physical and/or psychological restrictions set by the employee\u2019s\nor employer\u2019s physician. The employee remains appointed to his or her current\nposition throughout the light work assignment.  \n  \n_Modified work_ : Work with changes in the non-essential or marginal usual and\ncustomary duties and/or responsibilities of the employee\u2019s current work.  \n  \n_Physician_ : A doctor of medicine, a dentist, a chiropractor, an osteopath, a\nnaturopath, a psychologist, an optometrist, a podiatrist, or an advanced\npractice registered nurse, as defined by Chapter 386, Hawaii Revised Statutes\n(HRS).  \n  \n_Priority placement_ : A job placement made to a position for employees who\nare permanently unable to return to their usual and customary work because of\na compensable WC injury or illness.

Executive Policy\n\nEmployees who have permanent restriction(s) and who are permanently unable to\nreturn to their current position because of a work injury may be provided with\npossible placement in a suitable alternate position within the University for\nwhich the employee is qualified. The Office of Human Resources (OHR) shall\nwork with the affected employee\u2019s designated Human Resources Representative\n(HR Rep) throughout the placement process.  \n  \n\n  1. General Provisions\n  \n\n    1. Job search and placement shall be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Return to Work Priority Placement Program (RTWPPP). Disputes arising from the RTWPPP are not subject to the grievance procedure of collective bargaining agreements. \n  \n\n    2. The job search shall be conducted in the following order and movement to the next level shall occur only if no suitable position is found within the level being considered: \n  \n\n      1. In the employee\u2019s designated campus.\n  \n\n      2. University-wide.\n  \n\n    3. Work-injured employees who have permanent restrictions related to his or her compensable WC claim shall be referred to the OHR RTWPPP by the Office of Risk Management (ORM). This policy addresses a component of \u00a712-14-5 criteria for an approved vocational rehabilitation plan, of Hawai\u2018i Administrative Rules Title 12 Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Subtitle 3 Disability Compensation Division, Chapter 14 Rehabilitation, Subchapter 2 Review and Approval of Vocational Rehabilitation Plans. \n  \n\n  2. Responsibilities\n  \n\n    1. Return to Work Assessment\n  \n\n      1. The WC Claims Manager will continuously assess the medical information received on a compensable WC claim and may determine, in consultation with ORM, that an employee on Temporary Total Disability (TTD) may be able to return to some type of employment.\n  \n\n      2. When the assessment indicates that the employee could possibly return to regular work or light work, the WC Claims Manager will obtain a completed Estimated Functional Capacity Evaluation (EFC) and/or Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment (MFCA) form from a physician.\n  \n\n    2. Upon review of the completed information, if the employee has permanent restrictions and is at maximum medical improvement (MMI), the WC Claims Manager, in consultation with ORM, will determine if the employee:\n  \n\n      1. Is able to return to regular work (no further assessment required);\n  \n\n      2. Is able to return to regular work with modification (continuing assessment required);\n  \n\n      3. Is continuing to recover from the WC injury and is able to perform light work (a temporary light work assignment shall be considered); or\n  \n\n      4. Is unable to return to regular or modified work on a permanent basis but is able to perform alternate work (employee is referred to OHR for job search and efforts are made to place the employee in a position with alternate work).\n  \n\n      5. If a job profile is necessary to determine the physical and/or psychological demands of the position, the unit\u2019s HR Rep, OHR, and the WC Claims Manager, in coordination with ORM, shall coordinate its completion for a compensable work injury or illness.\n  \n\n    3. Light Work\n  \n\n      1. Light Work Assignments\n  \n\n        1. The WC Claims Manager shall work with the employee\u2019s HR Rep to consider temporary modification of the employee\u2019s regular work duties and responsibilities to accommodate the employee\u2019s temporary light work restrictions. OHR shall assist in this effort when needed and requested.\n  \n\n        2. Where temporary modification of the employee\u2019s regular work is not possible, the employee may be assigned to light work tasks within the University..\n  \n\n        3. A physician must approve and provide the parameters for the employee\u2019s light work assignment. The employee\u2019s HR Rep, as appropriate, shall provide the WC Claims Manager with a completed Temporary Light Duty Job Analysis for the physician\u2019s approving signature.\n  \n\n        4. Employees shall accept offers of light work assignment as determined suitable by the WC Claims Manager and the employee\u2019s supervisor/HR Rep/Dean/Director based on the restrictions set by the physician.\n  \n\n        5. If light duty assignments are unavailable in the employee\u2019s hiring unit, the employee may be referred to another unit by OHR, but will retain their current position and compensation.\n  \n\n        6. An employee who refuses a light work assignment that has been determined suitable shall have Temporary Total Disability or Temporary Partial Disability benefits suspended. If an employee fails to report to an approved light duty assignment, they shall be placed on unauthorized leave of absence from work for the hours that the employee should be on work status. Appropriate disciplinary action may also be taken by the Appointing Authority.\n  \n\n    4. Light Work Pay  \nThe employee on a temporary light work assignment remains appointed to his or\nher current position throughout the assignment. The employee, therefore,\nreceives their normal salary in the position; however, if the light work\nassignment is for a reduced number of hours than the employee\u2019s normal work\nhours in the position, appropriate adjustment will be made in accordance with\nstatutory requirements.\n\n  \n\n    5. Release from Light Work  \nThe employee\u2019s participation in the light work assignment concludes when the\nemployee:\n\n  \n\n      1. Is released to regular duty by a physician;\n  \n\n      2. Is placed in modified or alternate work;\n  \n\n      3. Refuses placement in suitable light work assignments; or\n  \n\n      4. Is deemed to have a permanent restriction, and is therefore eligible for RTWPPP.\n  \n\n    6. RTWPPP\n  \n\n      1. Criteria for Participation  \nTo participate in a priority placement through the RTWPPP, an employee shall\nbe released by a physician to return to alternate work after the physician has\ndetermined that the employee is permanently unable to perform any or all of\nthe essential functions of the employee\u2019s regular pre-injury position because\nof their permanent restrictions due to their compensable WC injury.  \n  \nIf the employee has permanent WC-related restrictions, the employee\u2019s unit HR\nRep along with the employee\u2019s supervisor/Dean/Director, will review and\ndetermine if they can reasonably accommodate the WC-related permanent\nrestrictions on a permanent basis.  \n  \nAny change in the employee\u2019s medical condition must be reported by the\nphysician to the WC Claims Manager for the change to be considered in the\npriority placement process. The WC Claims Manager, in coordination with ORM,\nshall notify OHR of the change.  \n  \nGuidelines on the management of the RTWPPP, including Employee Notice,\nEmployee Meeting, Employee Eligibility Period, Employee Job Search, Employee\nPlacement, and Discharge are found in the attached Guidelines.  \n  \nInability to place the employee with a permanent disability in alternate work\nmay result in discharge of employment.\n\n  \n  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nThis policy describes the actions to be taken to strengthen the proper\nmanagement of risks through proactive risk identification, risk management,\nand risk acceptance pertaining to all activities within the University of\nHawaii.  \n  \nRisk is inherent in all academic, administrative and business activities of\nthe University. It is neither possible, nor advantageous, to entirely\neliminate risk from an activity without ceasing that activity. It is\nUniversity policy for every employee to act to reduce the risk of such\naccidental loss or injury to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with\ncarrying out of the University's mission of teaching, research, service and\noutreach. University resources must be protected from financial loss resulting\nfrom such events.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nRisk is defined as the effect of uncertainty on objectives. It applies to any\nissue that could impact the ability of the institution to meet its objectives.  \n  \nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) expands the concept of risk management. It is\nthe consistent, structured and process-driven tool that enables University\nleadership and management to identify, assess, evaluate, mitigate, monitor,\nprioritize and respond to risk that affects the achievement of University\nstrategic goals and objectives.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nTo accomplish the goal of effective management of risks, the University's risk\nmanagement program is established to identify and analyze loss exposure and\nsafety hazards, develop and select the best techniques or combination of\ntechniques for treating risks, implement effective administration of each risk\ntreatment plan, and monitor the results produced or achievement of change.  \n  \nCampus administrators shall ensure compliance with this policy at every level\nof operation.  \n  \nA. RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES  \n  \nThe University may elect to utilize one or more of the following strategies to\naddress risk:  \n  \n1\\. Avoid undesirably high risks by refusing to undertake unsafe activities or\nby discontinuing high-risk programs;  \n  \n2\\. Reduce risk through oversight and management at all levels of the\nenterprise;  \n  \n3\\. Retain risk, up to a reasonable level through a program of self-insurance;\nand  \n  \n4\\. Transfer risk to another party or reduce a certain amount of exposure\nthrough processes such as insurance  \n  \nB. RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISK AVOIDANCE  \n  \nIt is the responsibility of each unit and its personnel to conduct business in\nsuch a way as to avoid obvious or known hazards to individuals and the\nUniversity and to evaluate the risk potential when undertaking any projects,\nprograms or activities.  \n  \nC. RISK REDUCTION METHODS  \n  \nAll University employees and programs shall be responsible for ensuring that\nexposure to known or reasonably anticipated risks be reduced by using common\nsense and good judgment. Risk of loss shall be evaluated from an individual,\ndepartment and campus viewpoint and proactively addressed through proper\ntraining and supervision. Conditions and practices which may cause loss shall\nbe eliminated or modified whenever possible. Activities involving elevated\nrisk shall be properly vetted and approved by the Chancellor or his designee.  \n  \nD. RISK RETENTION  \n  \nThe University self-insures against normal and expected losses for a broad\nscope of third party liability losses. Payments are made through the Risk\nManagement Special Fund (\u201cRMSF\u201d). The RMSF pays the University\u2019s settlements\nand judgments, system-wide insurance premiums, retention payments, litigation\nexpenses incurred by the University General Counsel, and risk management\nrelated expenses. The program is funded through annual assessments of each\ncampus. The University\u2019s Office of Risk Management is responsible for\nadministering and maintaining the fund.  \n  \nE. RISK TRANSFER  \n  \nThe financial responsibility for risks may be transferred to others through\ncontractual agreements or through the purchase of insurance. Methods for\ntransferring risk include third party waivers, hold harmless agreements, or\nthrough vendor contracting. Insurance is a technique to finance some loss\nexposures and a part of the broader concept of risk management. Commercially\ninsuring risks does not alter the responsibility of the University, its units,\nor personnel for compliance with required and appropriate safety and security\nstandards. System-wide insurance policies shall be funded by the Risk\nManagement Special Fund and administered by the Office of Risk Management. All\nother insurance policies covering specific colleges, activities and programs\nshall be funded and administered by those schools, colleges, or programs\nrequiring the specialized insurance.  \n  \nF. ORGANIZATION  \n  \n1\\. The Office of Risk Management shall administer, coordinate, and evaluate\nthe risk management program of the University. The Director has the\nresponsibility and authority for the following:  \n  \na. Administer the Risk Management Special Fund;  \n  \nb.

Purpose\n\nGenerally speaking, all purchases with public funds should be made through a\ncompetitive process to ensure fair and reasonable prices for quality goods and\nservices. This typically is accomplished through Competitive Sealed Bidding\n(\u201cInvitation for Bids\u201d or \u201cIFB\u201d) or Competitive Sealed Proposals (\u201cRequest for\nProposal\u201d or \u201cRFP\u201d).  \n  \nThe Hawai\u2018i Public Procurement Code recognizes circumstances where \u201csmall\npurchases\u201d warrant a more expedient, simple and informal procurement method of\ngoods and services. This procedure sets forth the thresholds for small\npurchases that do not require public notice or public bid openings that are\nassociated with IFBs and RFPs. This procedure incorporates the requirements of\nthe laws, rules and regulations of the State of Hawai\u2018i and Board of Regents\npolicies.  \nThese procedures shall not apply to exempt, sole source, or emergency\nprocurements.  \n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nThe definitions set forth in Administrative Procedure (AP) 8.215 for the\nprocurement of goods, services, and construction for the University of Hawai'i\nshall apply to this procedure.  \n  \n\n##  III. General Policy\n\n  1. _Small Purchase Threshold._ Any procurement less than $100,000 for goods and services made in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth herein shall be considered a Small Purchase. Any procurement not made in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth herein shall be conducted through Competitive Sealed Bidding (AP 8.235), Competitive Sealed Proposals (AP 8.240) or Professional Services Procurement (AP 8.245). \n  \n\n  2. _Construction._ Any procurement of construction as defined in AP 8.215 shall be governed by AP 8.281. \n  \n\n  3. _Multiple Purchases._ Multiple purchases shall not be created at the inception of a transaction so as to circumvent the bidding procedures for formally advertised procurements, and procurement requirements shall not be artificially divided or parceled so as to constitute a Small Purchase under this section. \n  \n\n  4. _Professional Services._ Contracts for \u201cprofessional services\u201d less than $100,000 may be procured in accordance with these procedures or the procedures provided in AP 8.245, Professional Services Procurement; provided that design professional services furnished by licensees under Chapter 464, HRS, shall only be procured in accordance with the Professional Services procedures in AP 8.281. \n  \n\n  5. _Lowest Responsive Quotation._ Any award for small purchases shall be made to the lowest responsive quotation. Consideration of evaluation criteria other than price can only be made through Competitive Sealed Proposals (AP 8.240). \n  \n\n  6. _HCE Compliance._ A certificate of vendor compliance is required under Section 103D-310, HRS for all Small Purchases of $2,500 or more (hereafter \u201cHCE Compliance\u201d). For more information, visit https://vendors.ehawaii.gov/hce/splash/welcome.html.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n##  IV. Small Purchases less than $5,000\n\n  1. _No Minimum Number of Quotations Required._ Although University programs should seek to obtain adequate and reasonable competition through available means, no minimum number of quotations is required for purchases less than $5,000. \n  \n\n  2. _HCE Compliance Required._ As stated in section III.F., a certificate of vendor compliance is required under HRS Section 103D-310 for all Small Purchases of $2,500 or more. \n\n  \n  \n\n##  V. Small Purchases totaling $5,000 but less than $100,000\n\n  1. _SuperQUOTE required._ Subject to the exceptions set forth in Section V.B. below, all Small Purchases totaling $5,000 but less than $100,000 shall be solicited via SuperQUOTE, the electronic online request for quotations system. Instructions on the use of SuperQUOTE may be accessed at www.commercepoint.com.  \n  \n\n  2. _SuperQUOTE not required but optional._  \n  \n\n    1. Solicitation of electronic quotations via SuperQUOTE is not required for the following purchases less than $25,000 (hereafter \u201cExceptions to SuperQUOTE\u201d):\n  \n\n      1. Procurements of professional services; \n  \n\n      2. Purchases of airline tickets and hotel accommodations; or\n  \n\n      3. Purchases where the use of SuperQUOTE is not practicable or advantageous, as approved in advance by the Office of Procurement Management (OPM). OPM Form 148, Request for Exception to Use of SuperQUOTE in Source Selection shall be used for this purpose. \n  \n\n    2. Purchases of those Exceptions to SuperQUOTE totaling $5,000 but less than $15,000 shall be made by obtaining three or more verbal or written quotations. If verbal quotations are solicited, a written quotation should be obtained from the awarded vendor as supporting documentation for the purchase request. \n  \n\n    3. Purchases of those Exceptions to SuperQUOTE totaling $15,000 but less than $25,000 shall be made by obtaining three or more written quotations. \n  \n\n  3. _Inability to Solicit or Obtain Minimum Quotations._ When the minimum quotations are not solicited or obtained for reasons such as insufficient sources, written justification shall be placed in the procurement file. \n  \n\n  4. _Request for Quotations (RFQ)._ The following guidelines for soliciting and evaluating quotations shall apply when utilizing SuperQUOTE or when processing an Exception to SuperQUOTE: \n  \n\n    1. Solicitation of Quotations\n  \n\n      1. When obtaining quotations, a complete description of the commodity should be provided. The description should set forth the minimum essential characteristics of the item required or the specific services the Contractor is required to perform. Unduly restrictive specifications that specify a particular feature of a product that is unique to one manufacturer shall not be used, unless the particular feature is required to meet the program's needs. \n  \n\n      2. Brand name specification followed by the words \"or acceptable alternate\" may be used, but its use shall be limited as much as possible. If brand name specifications are used, it is recommended that more than one brand be named. When using brand name specifications, state the brand name(s) or catalog number(s) and the minimum essential characteristics of the item required or the specific services requested. \n  \n\n      3. If only one brand is solicited and alternate brands are not acceptable, a sole brand justification must be provided stating reasons why only that brand will satisfy the program's requirements. (See AP 8.255 and OPM Form 144) \n  \n\n      4. Quotations shall include all delivery charges and applicable taxes; recommended language is as follows: \"All prices are f.o.b. (free on board) destination, including all applicable taxes.\" \n  \n\n      5. All vendors should be treated fairly and equitably. \n  \n\n      6. Sufficient time should be provided for the vendors to prepare a quotation. The length of time will vary with the particular circumstances and the vendor must not be \"pressured\" into preparing an insufficient or erroneous quotation. \n  \n\n      7. The RFQ shall specify the date and hour for the desired reply date. Eliminate indefinite words such as \"ASAP\" or \"reply immediately\"\n  \n\n      8. In general, firm delivery dates should not be used. It is recommended that delivery time be specified as a number of consecutive calendar days after receipt of order. \n  \n\n      9. Quotations are confidential until the time and date set for receipt of all quotations and after evaluation of the quotations has been completed. At the time that the purchase order is issued or the purchasing card order is placed, the quotations shall be made available to the public, if requested. \n  \n\n      10. OPM will assist programs having difficulties in obtaining quotations or making award(s) after quotations are received for purchases within their delegated purchasing authority. If OPM determines that the solicitation of quotations was inadequate or otherwise improper for any purchase and that the best interests of the University so require, OPM may direct the resolicitation of quotations for the subject expenditure. Moreover, OPM may direct the award to a vendor other than the one recommended by the program. Any such action by OPM will be coordinated with the program involved. \n  \n\n    2. Evaluation of Quotations  \n  \nQuotations shall be evaluated, and the purchase shall be awarded to the vendor\nsubmitting the lowest responsive quotation. To be considered for award,\nresponsive quotations must meet all the specifications and terms and\nconditions set forth in the RFQ. Features, capabilities, and terms that are\nnot stated in the RFQ shall not be considered in the evaluation of quotations.\nAll costs of freight, insurance and taxes shall be included in the RFQ and\ndetermined before making an award. Programs having difficulties in making an\naward after quotations are received may contact OPM for assistance.  \n  \nIn the event that the vendor submitting the lowest quotation does not meet the\nspecifications and/or terms and conditions set forth in the RFQ, the low quote\nshall be rejected and the vendor shall be notified of the reasons for\nrejection. Justification shall be included in the procurement file regarding\nreasons for non-selection of the lowest quotation. The remaining quotations\nshall be considered until award can be made to the vendor submitting the\nlowest quotation that meets or exceeds all specifications, terms and\nconditions.  \n  \nEvaluate and award promptly. Keep in mind that many quotations have an\nexpiration date. If the expenditure exceeds the fiscal administrator's\npurchasing authority, the period of time that the quotation is available for\nacceptance must be sufficient to allow review by a designated departmental\nfiscal administrator with greater purchasing authority or by OPM, as\napplicable.\n\n  \n\n      1. Firm Price vs. Estimated Price  \n  \nFirm prices and estimated prices should be distinguished when evaluating\nquotations.  \nPurchase orders should not be awarded based on an estimated price. Firm Price\nand Estimated Price are distinguished as follows:\n\n  \n\n        1. Firm Price  \n  \nA firm price offer is an offer by a vendor to provide goods or services in a\nsigned, written quotation which shall be valid for a specific time period or,\nif no such time is stated, for a reasonable time.  \n  \nThe price agreed to by the vendor and the University when the order is placed\nwill not change until the commodity is delivered and the transaction\ncompleted. Catalog, brochure, advertisement or flyer prices are not firm\nprices but offers to negotiate. Therefore, prices obtained from these sources\nare never to be considered firm.\n\n  \n\n        2. Estimated Price  \n  \nEstimated price is an approximate calculation only and the vendor is not bound\nby the price provided.\n\n  \n\n      2. Taxes (Refer to AP 8.220)  \n  \nSince Hawai'i permits the vendor to pass excise taxes on to the consumer,\nrequests for quotations should include the phrase \"including all applicable\ntaxes.\"\n\n  \n\n      3. Delivery and Shipping Charges  \n  \nRFQ should state that prices are f.o.b. destination, which is defined as free\non board and point where title passes. It is to the advantage of the\nUniversity to have the title pass in Hawai'i. The seller assumes the\nresponsibility for risk of transportation including the filing of claims for\nlosses or damages. If title passes before it is shipped to the University, the\nUniversity assumes this responsibility. If shipping charges are not included\nin the price, it should be quoted as a separate line item.\n\n  \n\n      4. Only One Quotation Received  \n  \nFor purchases of $5,000 or more where vendors are solicited but only one\nquotation is received, award of a purchase order may be made to the vendor\nsubmitting the sole quotation if the price is determined to be fair and\nreasonable and the basis for the decision is included in the procurement file.\nThis determination may be based on a comparison of the proposed price with\nprices found reasonable on previous expenditures for similar items, discounts\ngiven to the University from the vendor's normal fee, comparisons with\nexpenditures of similar institutions, comparisons with catalog prices, the\nbuyer's or fiscal administrator's personal knowledge of the item being\npurchased, or any other means. OPM Form 95 should be utilized to establish\nprice reasonableness and maintained in the procurement file.\n\n  \n\n      5. No Quotations Received  \n  \nIf no quotations are received, it shall be determined whether it is neither\npracticable nor advantageous to the University to issue another request for\nquotations. For purposes of this determination, consideration shall be given\nto whether the preparation of revised specifications for the request could\nresult in quotations being received, as well as the reasons why it would be\nneither practicable nor advantageous, e.g., time constraints, lack of\ncompetition in the marketplace, etc. If this determination is made, an\nalternative procurement method, e.g., informal solicitation of quotations,\ndirect negotiations, etc., may be used to make the purchase. The foregoing\ndetermination may be made by fiscal administrators when acting within their\npurchasing authority; otherwise, the matter shall be forwarded to the OPM for\nreview and determination. Documentation of the alternative procurement\ndetermination shall be made part of the procurement file.\n\n  \n\n    3. Verbal Quotations\n  \n\n      1. All verbal quotations received may be recorded on the University of Hawai'i \"Record of Verbal Quotations\" form (OPM Form 31 (see Instructions for Completion of University of Hawai'i Record of Verbal Quotations Form)) or an alternative form deemed acceptable by the purchasing officer and placed in the procurement file in order to demonstrate the propriety of placing the order at the price quoted with the vendor concerned. In most cases, the procurement file should include the completed \"Record of Verbal Quotations\" form, or alternative form, a written quotation from the vendor who submitted the lowest verbal quotation, and a copy of the requisition and purchase order awarded. \n  \n\n      2. Electronic (e-mail/Internet) and facsimile (fax) quotations are acceptable for those purchases that require verbal quotations. \n  \n\n      3. Upon determination of the lowest quoted price, a written quotation should be obtained from the vendor submitting the lowest verbal quotation. \n  \n\n    4. Written Quotations   \n  \nWritten quotations should be obtained by utilizing the SuperQUOTE system. For\npurchases not subject to the use of SuperQUOTE as specified in Section D, the\nstandard University of Hawai'i \"Request for Quotation (RFQ)\" form (OPM Form 32\n(see Instructions for Preparation of Hard Copy University of Hawai'i Request\nfor Quotation Form)) may be used to obtain written quotations from vendors.\nAll quotations received shall be retained in the procurement file.  \n  \nElectronic (e-mail/Internet) and Facsimile (fax) quotations are acceptable for\nthose purchases that require written quotations.\n\n  \n  \n\n##  VI. Guidelines for all Purchases made with a Purchase Order\n\nThe following guidelines apply to all purchases made with a Purchase Order  \n  \n\n  1. _Authority for Issuance of Purchase Orders_\n  \n\n    1. Approval of Purchase Request  \n  \nEach purchase request must be authorized by a responsible official in charge\nof the applicable program to certify that the purchase is consistent with the\nprogram it is intended to support.\n\n  \n\n    2. Certification of Funds and Compliance with University Policies and Procedures  \n  \nThe fiscal administrator responsible for the funds of the applicable program\nshall certify that sufficient funds are available to pay for the goods or\nservices, and that the purchase is in accordance with applicable University\npolicies and procedures.\n\n  \n\n    3. Delegated Purchasing Authority  \n  \nFiscal administrators receive their delegated purchasing authority from the\nVice President or Chancellor who has fiscal jurisdiction over their respective\ndepartmental units. Only individuals who have been granted purchasing\nauthority can issue purchase orders within their delegated limits.  \nIndividuals who issue purchase orders which exceed their delegated limits may\nhave their purchasing authority revoked, may be held personally responsible\nfor the purchase, and may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\n  \n\n  2. _Requisitions and Purchase Orders Process_\n  \n\n    1. General  \n  \nThe requisition should be used to request the expenditure of funds for goods\nor services by purchase order. Requisitions shall be submitted through\nappropriate staff and fiscal administrators for approval and purchasing\naction.\n\n  \n\n    2. Action by Program\n  \n\n      1. Prepare the requisition pursuant to instructions in this section for Preparing Electronically Generated Purchasing Documents. \n  \n\n      2. Complete pertinent supporting documents as appropriate and obtain approvals by pertinent approving authorities. \n  \n\n      3. Route requisition package to fiscal administrator for further processing. \n  \n\n    3. Action by Fiscal Administrator\n  \n\n      1. Verify purchase specifications, including but not limited to, vendor name/address, delivery method and deadlines, special order instructions, amounts, account code(s), object code(s), and addresses. \n  \n\n      2. Ensure that description is adequate and precise. \n  \n\n      3. Verify that purchase is in accordance with state and federal laws, rules and regulations and University policy. \n  \n\n      4. Examine and verify request for quotations. \n  \n\n      5. Verify basis for award. \n  \n\n      6. Verify requisite approvals. \n  \n\n      7. Certify fund availability and policy compliance by approving requisition. \n  \n\n      8. Approve requisition to generate purchase order. \n  \n\n      9. Ensure that purchase order terms and conditions are attached. \n  \n\n      10. If requirement is within fiscal administrator's approving authority, sign and issue purchase order. \n  \n\n      11. If requirement exceeds departmental purchasing authority, the requisition, request for quotations, and supporting documents shall be routed to the OPM for approval and issuance of a purchase order. \n  \n\n  3. _Preparing Electronically Generated Purchasing Documents._   \n  \nRefer to Kuali Financial System, User Guides, which are available at the\nfollowing website: http://www.fmo.hawaii.edu/financial_systems/index.html.\n\n  \n\n  4. _Administration of Purchase Orders_\n  \n\n    1. Procurement File  \n  \nAll quotations received shall be recorded and placed in the procurement file.\nWhen a specified number of quotations are required but are not obtained, e.g.,\nsufficient sources are not available, the reason(s) shall be recorded and\nplaced in the procurement file.  \n  \nThe procurement file should contain the following documents, where applicable:\n\n  \n\n      1. Requisition; \n  \n\n      2. Quotations - written, and/or a Record of Verbal Quotations or alternative form; \n  \n\n      3. Abstract of prices from each vendor; \n  \n\n      4. Written justification when award is made to other than the vendor submitting the lowest quotation; \n  \n\n      5. Purchase order and/or other contractual document; \n  \n\n      6. Purchase order change form and any modifications to the specifications; \n  \n\n      7. Evidence of purchase completion and date; \n  \n\n      8. Copy of payment document; and\n  \n\n      9. Correspondence\n  \n\n  5. _Purchase Order Amendments_\n  \n\n    1. General\n  \n\n      1. A purchase order amendment (as referred to in the Kuali Financial System) is written documentation of a change or modification to a purchase order after it has been issued to the vendor. Purchase order amendments serve as formal notification to the vendor of a change to a previously issued purchase order, and should be used to clarify the order specifications, thereby minimizing potential liability to University departments and personnel relating to the order. Accordingly, while a purchase order amendment would generally not be required for minor or non-substantial modifications, purchase order amendments should be issued when there are significant modifications to material elements of the order, as determined by the fiscal administrator, which affect price (e.g., quantity, unit price, total dollar amount, etc.), delivery (e.g., delivery date or method, etc.), or terms (e.g., item specifications, payment terms, period of performance, etc.). In addition, when the modification, even if minor, would result in a purchase which exceeds the limits of a fiscal administrator\u2019s purchasing authority, a purchase order amendment should be issued. \n  \n\n      2. Examples of conditions which would call for the issuance of a purchase order amendment to the vendor include: \n  \n\n        1. Increase or decrease in quantity; \n  \n\n        2. Significant increase in total dollar amount; \n  \n\n        3. Changes to purchase orders issued by OPM; \n  \n\n        4. Changes to purchase orders which result in a purchase which exceeds the limits of a fiscal officer\u2019s purchasing authority; \n  \n\n        5. Changes which would significantly alter the original specifications of the item(s) to be purchased or would significantly modify the terms of the purchase; \n  \n\n        6. Significant changes in delivery dates or method of delivery; \n  \n\n        7. Partial or total cancellation of the order. \n  \n\n      3. Examples of conditions which would not necessitate the issuance of a purchase order amendment to the vendor include: \n  \n\n        1. Vendor-initiated decrease in quantity about which the University is notified in writing by the vendor due to its inability to fulfill the order; \n  \n\n        2. Price increases of a non-substantial amount, as determined by the fiscal administrator, for purchase orders issued under the fiscal officer\u2019s purchasing authority and which would not result in a purchase which exceeds that authority; \n  \n\n        3. Addition of or changes to tax, shipping charges or insurance, in any dollar amount deemed reasonable by the fiscal administrator, on purchase orders issued under the fiscal administrator\u2019s purchasing authority and which would not result in a purchase which exceeds that authority; \n  \n\n        4. Any decrease in dollar amount. \n  \n\n    2. Procedure  \n  \nThe procedure for issuing a purchase order amendment is as follows:\n\n  \n\n      1. If the changed order results in a purchase which remains within the limits of a fiscal administrator\u2019s purchasing authority, the purchase order amendment should be issued by the fiscal administrator. \n  \n\n      2. If the changed order results in a purchase which exceeds the limits of a fiscal administrator\u2019s purchasing authority, the fiscal administrator should initiate the purchase order amendment and forward it, together with any required supporting documentation, to a designated departmental fiscal administrator with greater purchasing authority or to the OPM, as applicable, for review and execution. \n  \n\n      3. The purchase order amendment should not be used to change the vendor with whom you are doing business or to add new items to the purchase order. In these instances, another purchase order should be issued to the new vendor or for the new items. However, a purchase order amendment form may be used to add taxes, shipping charges or insurance to the purchase order. \n  \n\n      4. Purchase order amendments may also be used as a processing document to record internal University changes, e.g., account/object code changes, addition of new account/object codes, vendor code changes, etc. If the purchase order amendment is being used to record internal University changes only, a copy should not be issued to the vendor. \n  \n\n    3. Preparation of Purchase Order Amendment\n  \n\n      1. Refer to Kuali Financial System, User Guides, which are available at the following website: http://www.fmo.hawaii.edu/financial_systems/index.html, to prepare electronically generated purchase order amendments. \n  \n\n  6. _Status of Purchase Orders_  \n  \nAfter purchase orders are awarded, fiscal administrators shall be responsible\nfor maintaining their status to assure that vendors deliver goods and perform\nservices in accordance with the delivery schedule specified in the purchase\norders. To preclude long outstanding purchase orders, fiscal administrators\nshall maintain a suspense file which will indicate delinquency one day after\nthe due date. On the day following the due date, fiscal administrators shall\ninitiate follow-up by telephone, if feasible, or by letter with a requirement\nfor the vendor to reply by a specified date. If telephone inquiry is made,\nfiscal administrators shall document the purchase order file to show the date,\nname of person contacted, and record of conversation, for future reference.\nWhen inquiries reveal excessive delays in making delivery without valid\nreason(s), consideration shall be given to canceling the order and reordering\nfrom another vendor.  \n  \nWhere a large, complex and important order or an order that has been placed\nwith a vendor of uncertain capability is involved, follow-up shall be made\nperiodically between award and delivery date to detect any probable\ndifficulties in advance. Complete files shall be maintained on these cases to\nsupport the University in any subsequent dispute action.\n\n  \n\n  7. _Receipt and Acceptance of Supplies or Services_\n  \n\n    1. Inspection and Acceptance  \n  \nThe buyer has the right before payment or acceptance to inspect the goods at\nany reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. Expenses of\ninspection shall be borne by the buyer. The procedure for inspection is as\nfollows:\n\n  \n\n      1. Check all packages and weights against shipper's manifest. \n  \n\n      2. Observe and record the condition of packing or other evidence of rough or faulty handling, with the carrier's representative present, prior to acceptance. \n  \n\n      3. Check all items to ascertain conformance with the supplier's packing slip. \n  \n\n      4. Open all packages immediately after delivery and check to determine that goods received are as ordered. \n  \n\n      5. Record overages, shortages, and damaged and incorrect materials. \n  \n\n      6. If necessary, perform testing of the goods. \n  \n\n      7. If goods are damaged: \n  \n\n        1. Do not dispose of shipping containers; \n  \n\n        2. Do not move the goods until the carrier's claim representative has made an inspection. \n  \n\n      8. Notify the carrier immediately (by telephone and follow-up in writing) of any shipment problems.  \n  \nMaintain a \"log\" of all events, stating names, dates and locations. If the\ngoods are conforming, the buyer has an obligation to pay for the goods\naccepted. However, if the goods are nonconforming, the buyer must immediately\nnotify the vendor that the goods are unacceptable and specify the reason for\nrejection if the defects are ascertainable by inspection. Failure to notify\nthe seller immediately of any defect(s) may constitute acceptance and the\nbuyer may have no legal recourse. In general, the parties to a contract are\nexcused from their performance obligations when performance has been rendered\nimpossible or unreasonably burdensome by circumstance beyond the control of\nthe parties at the time the contract was consummated. Under these\ncircumstances, the seller must notify the buyer immediately that the seller is\nunable to fulfill the terms of the contract and state the reason for\nnonperformance.\n\n  \n\n    2. Receipt and Certification of Goods, Services, and Construction  \n  \nRefer to Kuali Financial System, User Guides, which are available at the\nfollowing website: http://www.fmo.hawaii.edu/financial_systems/index.html\n\n  \n\n    3. Receipt of Damaged, Defective, or Discrepant Goods  \n  \nAfter conducting the inspection as outlined in subparagraph 1, Inspection and\nAcceptance, and defects are noted, the requisitioner shall retain all bills of\nlading, airway bills, packing slips, damaged containers or goods, and copies\nof invoices and forward them to the fiscal administrator. The fiscal\nadministrator will contact the vendor for replacement.\n\n  \n\n    4. Report of Discrepant Shipping or Invoicing  \n  \nMistakes in invoicing or shipping shall be reported to the fiscal\nadministrator, referring to the order number and vendor involved, so that\nnegotiations or corrections can be conducted. Fiscal administrators shall\nmaintain a detailed report of negotiations or attempts at correction.\n\n  \n\n  8. _Use of Non-Standard Purchase Orders_\n  \n\n    1. The following libraries are authorized to issue departmental purchase orders in lieu of standard University purchase orders for research and reference materials including books, maps, periodicals and pamphlets, which are published in print, video, audio, magnetic, or electronic form: \n  \n\n      1. Hamilton Library \n  \n\n      2. Sinclair Library\n  \n\n      3. Law Library\n  \n\n      4. Community Colleges Libraries \n  \n\n      5. UH Hilo Library \n  \n\n      6. UH West Oahu Library\n  \nThe libraries shall be exempt from the requirement for certification of fund\navailability on the purchase order form.  \n  \n\n    2. The UH Bookstores are authorized to issue departmental purchase orders in lieu of standard University purchase orders for resale items only. UH Bookstores shall be exempt from the requirement for certification of fund availability on the purchase order form. \n  \n  \n\n##  VII. Purchase Contracts\n\nFiscal administrators are authorized to execute purchase contracts (e.g.,\nequipment maintenance and rental agreements, software license agreements,\netc.) within their purchasing authority.  \n  \nMost terms and conditions in vendor contracts are acceptable to the University\nand their forms can be used to effect a contract. However, fiscal\nadministrators shall not execute contracts with clauses requiring the\nUniversity to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless contractors and/or third\nparties, to submit to arbitration, or to pay attorney's fees and costs of\ncontractors or third parties. Fiscal administrators shall review the terms and\nconditions of vendor contracts pertaining to indemnification, liability,\ndamages, attorney's fees, arbitration, and other questionable areas. Questions\non contract provisions pertaining to the aforementioned areas may be referred\nto the Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs and University General\nCounsel. Questions pertaining to insurance should be referred to the Office of\nRisk Management for review.  \n  \n\n##  VIII. Delegation of Authority\n\nIn accordance with Executive Policy (EP) 8.105, the Vice President for\nAdministration and his/her designees are delegated authority to carry out the\nresponsibilities relating to the procurement of goods, services, and\nconstruction for the University of Hawai'i, consistent with applicable law and\nBoard of Regents policies, and to execute contractual documents relating to\nsuch procurement actions.  \n  \nIn accordance with EP 8.107, Vice Presidents and Chancellors and their\ndesignees are delegated authority to execute contractual documents for\nprocuring goods, services, and construction in amounts less than $25,000. Such\nauthority may be delegated to fiscal administrators of departmental units\nunder their direction and jurisdiction.  \n  \n\n##  IX. Contact Information\n\nOffice of Procurement Management, Tel.

Academic Affairs  \nExecutive Policy EP 5.230, Small Undergraduate and Graduate Course Sections  \nEffective Date: February 2021  \nPrior Dates Amended: April 1985; June 1987, abolished 2014  \nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and\nPolicy  \nGoverning Board of Regents Policy: RP 5.201, Instructional Programs & RP\n5.213, General Education  \nReview Date: February 2024  \n\n##  I. Purpose\n\nThis executive policy seeks to balance the legitimate educational objectives\nserved by small course sections with the importance of ensuring that\ninstructional resources are used effectively by monitoring class size each\nsemester. Units shall demonstrate to the administration and Board of Regents\nthat a sound rationale exists for any continued delivery of small classes. The\nVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs or equivalent at each campus is\nresponsible for campus reporting to the Vice President of Academic Policy and\nPlanning, who may provide periodic updates to the Board of Regents. The\nobjectives of this policy are:  \n\n  \n\n  1. To establish common definitions of small course sections.\n  \n\n  2. To establish common policy guidelines for the review of class size.\n  \n\n  3. To establish required procedures for monitoring and reporting of class size decisions.\n\n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nSmall undergraduate course sections: those that enroll fewer than ten students\nin a single section and that are supported by state General Funds or tuition.\nA single course is a course section under this policy.  \n  \nSmall graduate course sections: those that enroll fewer than five students in\na single section and that are supported by state General Funds or tuition. A\nsingle course is a course section under this policy.  \n  \nChief Academic Officer (CAO): the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs or\nequivalent.  \n  \nInstructional Unit Chair: A department or division chair or equivalent.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n  1. General Guidelines  \n  \n\n    1. This policy applies to small course sections as defined in this policy. This policy does not preclude campuses from developing other uniform metrics (i.e. a campus-wide fill rate).\n  \n\n    2. Course sections that are identified in the student information system as being individualized instruction, such as directed readings, practica, practice teaching, cooperative education, research, or one-on-one music instruction do not fall under this policy. The Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy shall maintain a list of class schedule types that are excluded from this policy. Such course sections should be reviewed as part of a campus' overall resource use assessment.\n  \n\n    3. Concurrent, cross-listed, and dual-listed course sections are reviewed on the basis of combined enrollment.\n  \n\n    4. Course sections that are targeted to a specific population and supported by federal, other state agency, or private funds or are paid for by special fees do not fall under this policy. Examples of such course sections include ROTC and early college classes that are taught on the high school campus.\n  \n\n    5. Consistent with this policy, departments may not schedule a course section with an enrollment being less than what is defined by this policy unless prior approval or an exception has been granted in advance. \n  \n\n    6. It is expected that any small undergraduate course sections that result from low enrollment would be at the upper division and graduate level due to the increasingly specialized nature of such instruction. Non-required course sections that have experienced low enrollment should be offered less often to achieve approriate enrollment levels. At the upper division, continued offering of small required course sections will trigger a curricular review of degree programs for which those course sections are required since low enrollment is one indication of limited student interest.\n  \n\n  \n\n  2. Process  \n  \n\n    1. All campuses will monitor small course sections during registration periods for Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters.\n  \n\n    2. Each campus shall establish a deadline, prior to the start of the semester, by which initial assessments will be made of course sections with enrollment below the thresholds in this policy. During this period, the Instructional Unit Chair may submit to the Dean (or CAO) any requests to retain course sections below the small course section limit and provide a justification for doing so. Final decisions on which small course sections to cancel must be made by the Friday before the beginning of classes for the semester.\n  \n\n    3. Course sections that met the limit up to the first day of classes, but fell below the limit after the first day of classes may continue to be taught if it would be too disruptive to the academic mission of the department. However, the Instructional Unit Chair (or equivalent) shall provide the Dean (or CAO) with a report of all small course sections that were offered each semester with an explanation of what happened and justification if they are to be offered in the future with steps to be taken to assure the course sections will meet enrollment targets in the future.\n  \n\n    4. The Dean (CAO) will provide a summary of the small course sections allowed to continue in the semester to the CAO by the 10th week of each semester. In the case of a campus where Divisions report directly to the CAO, the CAO will prepare the summary. The summary will explain why small course sections were permitted and steps to be taken to assure such course sections will meet enrollment targets in the future.\n  \n\n    5. If, after two semesters, the steps that had been provided to increase enrollment have not been successful, the following may be considered.  \n\n      1. Course taught in small sections without an exception shall be scheduled less frequently in order to achieve adequate enrollment\n  \n\n      2. If course sections across the Department\u2019s offerings are consistently low and the issue is not remedied, departments may have new hire requests denied and additional resources delayed until the situation is mitigated.\n  \n\n    6. Decisions regarding exceptions will be made by the Dean or the equivalent.\n  \n\n    7. The Dean or CAO may ask the program to address the small course section issue in the next program review by specifically discussing the following in the context of the curriculum.  \n\n      1. Number of course sections offered.\n  \n\n      2. Number of course sections that only serve as electives.\n  \n\n      3. Number of concentrations or degree tracks.\n  \n\n      4. Number of instructional staff needed to offer the required course sections.\n  \n\n      5. At the upper division, continued offering of small required course sections since low enrollment is one indication of limited student interest.\n  \n\n  \n\n  3. Possible justifications for continuing to offer small course sections:  \n  \n\n    1. In multiple-section courses, the average section enrollment is greater than the minimum and the added sections address overflow or other scheduling issues.\n  \n\n    2. If faculty are volunteering to teach a small course section in addition to fullfilling their full workload assignment.\n  \n\n    3. New or experimental classes (for two semesters only).\n  \n\n    4. Course sections that are small due to equipment limitations or programmatic accreditation requirements as formally acknowledged by the Dean or CAO to have continuing constraints.\n  \n\n    5. Small course sections identified as major requirements remain subject to review. If low enrollments persist over several semesters, the campus is asked to:  \n\n      1. reassess the importance of the course section to the major or graduation requirements and, if the course section is judged crucial,\n  \n\n      2. to offer the course section in alternate years or less often if possible.\n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThe President delegates to the Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy\nand to the Chancellors/Provost who have responsibility for implementing this\npolicy and fostering practices that facilitate informed small course review\nfor each campus.  \n\n##  V.

UH International Exchange Scholarships \u2013 are based on agreements made by a campus, several campuses, or the UH System with an international institution. They are fundamentally different from the UH International Student Scholarships in that they do not apply to students who are seeking a degree or certificate.  \n  \n\n      1. Student exchange agreements are reciprocal in nature, i.e., UH students register and pay tuition to their UH home campus and then attend a partner institution on a waived tuition basis. In turn, students from partner institutions pay their home institution and attend the UH campus tuition-free.\n  \n\n      2.

They must be a\nclassified new or continuing, full-time or part-time, undergraduate or\ngraduate or post-baccalaureate student in a teacher preparation program at any\ncampus or participate in a recognized pre-admission program maintained by\nvarious professional schools.\n\n  \n\n      3. Amount and Length of Scholarship  \n  \nThe amount and length of the scholarship is left to the discretion of the\nchancellors or their designee(s) based on campus mission and goals.\n\n  \n  \n\n  2. **Share of Tuition Revenue Set Aside**  \n  \nThe share of UH tuition revenues that may be allocated to student financial\nassistance shall vary by institutional type.  \n  \n\n    1.

The portion will be determined by the Chancellors working in conjunction with the system student affairs officer.\n  \n\n    2. Share of tuition assistance for non-need based aid  \n  \n\n      1. Each campus leader may determine the amount of tuition assistance for non-need-based aid based on campus missions and goals including, but not limited to, purposes outlined in Regents Policy developing high-quality academic programs and fostering diverse and stimulating campus environments.\n  \n\n      2. Campus leaders are to determine the appropriate distribution of funding among the UH Achievement Scholarships, UH International Student Scholarships, and/or UH Pacific Islander Scholarships in consultation with enrollment management leadership.\n  \n\n    3. Tuition assistance that is provided as a function or benefit of employment is not included in the foregoing amounts (i.e., such assistance may be above and beyond the amounts stipulated).\n  \n\n  3. Share of tuition assistance earmarked for residents  \n  \nThe portion of tuition revenues allocated to Hawai\u02bbi residents and non-\nresidents toward student financial assistance shall vary by institutional\ntype:  \n  \n\n    1.

This is in keeping with Executive Policy on campus ceilings for non-resident undergraduate enrollment, EP 5.208. Eligibility for need-based aid is determined according to federal financial aid guidelines, but Chancellors are given the latitude to adjust the determination of need in special cases.\n  \n\n    2. UH Achievement Scholarships \u2013 In all cases where there are equally qualified candidates, preference will go to Hawai\u02bbi resident students. Campuses may create UH Achievement Scholarships in keeping with their mission and program priorities.\n  \n\n  4. Share of tuition assistance earmarked for undergraduates  \n  \nThe portion of UH tuition revenues that shall be awarded to undergraduates and\nthe share that shall be awarded to graduate students shall be determined by\nthe Chancellor in keeping with the mission and program priorities of the\ncampus.\n\n  \n\n  5. The extent to which grants or scholarships are available for summer session or continuing education programs is delegated to the Chancellors.\n  \n\n  6. Students may receive more than one source of financial assistance. All financial assistance must be reported to the campus financial aid office, and if students receive any need-based aid, their total award must be coordinated by the campus financial aid office to ensure compliance with federal regulations.\n  \n\n  7. Annually, the University Officers shall complete a systematic review of all financial aid awarded using a report prepared by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Strategy. This review shall include, but is not limited to, dollars amounts awarded for need- and non-need-based aid, all sources of financial aid (institutional, state, federal, external sources, etc.), foregone tuition and adherence to this policy.\n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nAuthority to oversee and manage the student financial assistance program at a\ncampus is delegated to the campus chancellor.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nTo set forth policy regarding student housing goals, objectives, assignment\npriorities and room rates.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. Student Housing Goals for the University  \n  \n1\\. It shall be a goal of the university\u2019s student housing program to provide\nreasonable levels of accommodations for students who are residents of the\nstate.  \n  \nB. Objectives of the Student Housing Program  \n  \n1\\. There are two sets of objectives that guide the student housing program at\nthe university; one set is educational in nature and the other is managerial.\nThe educational objectives comprise a variety of commitments both to the\ndevelopment of the individual student and to the development of residence hall\ncommunities. The management objectives are expressed in the maintenance of\ncertain operational standards and fiscal accountability, while ensuring that\nthe students\u2019 health, safety and security are uncompromised in the design and\noperation of the residence halls. These dual objectives uniquely characterize\nstudent housing as both an educational program and an administrative function\nthat is managed in accordance with the highest operational, personnel, fiscal\nand safety standards.  \n  \nC. Student Housing Assignment Priorities  \n  \n1\\. As long as the demand for student housing exceeds its availability, there\nwill be a need to develop and maintain housing assignment policies that seek\nto assure that Hawai\u2018i resident students with the greatest physical and\neducational needs are assigned highest priority for suitable and available\nspaces. A student\u2019s physical need for housing is understood to increase in\ndirect proportion to the distance of the campus from the student\u2019s home and\nthe student\u2019s educational need for housing is considered greatest during the\nfirst year of college and diminishes thereafter. Within this context, the\nfirst objective of the housing assignment priority system is to provide space\nin student housing for all Hawai\u2018i resident students who live beyond\nreasonable commuting distance to the campus at which they are enrolled. The\nuniversity recognizes the educational desirability of achieving a diversity of\nresident and nonresident students in our housing facilities. Therefore, the\nuniversity supports the achievement of such diversity provided that the\nassignment of nonresident students is undertaken only after all high priority\nresident students have been accommodated. It must be understood that the\nfiscal soundness of the housing operation requires that application deadlines\nbe established, and that vacancies remaining after the processing of all\ntimely applications be filled on a first-come-first-served basis.  \n  \n2\\. Assignment priorities may make considerations to accommodate students\u2019\nspecial needs and campus and system enrollment goals as deemed by the\npresident or president\u2019s designee. Student housing assignment priorities for\nspecial campuses shall be delegated to the president or the president\u2019s\ndesignee.  \nD. Student Housing Room Rates  \n  \n1\\. Student housing room rates are established by the president or the\npresident\u2019s designee in accordance to guidelines set forth in executive\npolicy.  \n  \na. Housing rates for conferences. The board delegates to the president, who\nmay at his/her discretion delegate to the chancellors or their designees, the\nauthority to negotiate and set housing rates for conferences, provided that\nsaid rates shall enhance the support of the University Revenue Undertaking\nFund pursuant to the board\u2019s covenants in its Bond Resolution adopted on\nJanuary 18, 1973.  \n  \nb. The university adheres to all applicable local, state, and federal\nantidiscrimination laws including the state Discrimination in Real Property\nTransaction law (Section 515-1 et.seq., HRS) in providing student housing\nservices.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nSetting assignment priorities and room rates shall be delegated to the\npresident or the president\u2019s designee. See RP 7.205(C)(2) and (D)(1)(a).  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nThe University recognizes the use of online instructional materials, such as\ne-textbooks and software tools and services, can enhance and provide better\neducational experiences for students. These products and services, however,\nmay require the sharing of Student Data with Third Party Vendors whose\ntreatment of the data may raise potential privacy concerns. As a result, this\nPolicy sets forth the University\u2019s expectations of how our Student Data shall\nbe managed by external parties.  \n  \nIn response to concerns over student data privacy principles and practices,\nthis Policy: (1) establishes institutional requirements that limit the ways in\nwhich Third Party Vendors who enter into contracts with the University can use\nStudent Data as part of the delivery of good and services; (2) makes it easier\nfor faculty and staff to determine whether a Third Party Vendor\u2019s terms of use\nmay potentially violate students\u2019 privacy. This Policy is applicable to any\nformal or informal agreements made by faculty that require students to\npurchase products directly from Third Party Vendors for school purposes. This\npolicy is not intended to prohibit students from entering into third party\ncontracts independently for products they deem appropriate for their studies.  \n\n##  II.

Introduction.  \n  \n1\\. The board recognizes the valuable contribution of all co-curricular\nprograms and acknowledges their importance in the development of the\nknowledge, skills and qualities required to be successful in post-university\nendeavors. Co-curricular activities include, but are not limited to student\ngovernance, residential life, organizations that support social life or\nleisure activities, student publications and broadcasting, support and\ninvolvement in athletics and honor societies (hereafter collectively called\n\u201cco-curricular activities\u201d or \u201cstudent life programs and activities\u201d).  \n  \nStudent life programs and activities complement the university\u2019s academic\nmission by providing opportunities for practical experience in the actual\noperation of diverse organizations. These experiences empower students to be\nresponsible leaders in civic duties, community service or professional\nmatters. Co-curricular activities complement, extend, and reinforce academic\nlearning by serving as nontraditional classroom venues for the application of\nknowledge, skills, and attitudes learned in the instructional program.  \n  \nThe board encourages student life programs and activities that foster critical\nthinking, problem-solving, decision-making, and leadership skills development\nthat prepare students to become informed, responsible citizens who engage in,\nand continue to make contribution for the betterment of humanity and\nimprovement of our communities.  \n  \nB. Policy.  \n  \n1\\. The board encourages the establishment of a robust student life program,\nincluding the establishment of student organizations.  \n  \n2\\.

Purpose\n\n  1. Ensure institutional administrative capability and compliance with Federal Student aid (FSA) Title IV financial aid regulations regarding verification of students\u2019 initial attendance in post-secondary coursework. Standards of administrative capability require that institutions maintain adequate records for each FSA recipient. Students may become FSA recipients at any time. Records must clearly show that the student was eligible for the funds received and that the funds were disbursed in accordance with program regulations. This includes being able to confirm initial attendance of students:  \n\n    1. Students with Federal Direct Loans are not eligible for the loan unless the institution can confirm the student began attendance in enough courses to establish at least a half-time enrollment. \n  \n\n    2. For Federal Pell Grant, FSEOG, and Work Study recipients, if the student does not begin attendance in all of his or her classes, resulting in a change in the student\u2019s enrollment status, the institution must recalculate the student\u2019s award based on the lower enrollment status within a specified period of time. \n  \n\n    3. If a school disburses Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, TEACH Grant, Perkins Loan, or FSEOG funds, but the student never begins attending classes, an institution must return the disbursed funds to their programs\n  \n\n    4. For students in distance education courses, A determination that the student began attendance by participating in an academically-related activity must be made by the institution; a student's certification of attendance that is not supported by institutional documentation is not acceptable. \n  \n\n  2. Maintain accurate institutional records regarding student enrollment for federal reporting. Required reporting includes students\u2019 academic program information and accurate enrollment status.\n  \n\n  3. Consequences for non-compliance include discontinuation of financial aid monies for the campus for awarding to students.\n\n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n  1. Participation verification is the term used to document when a student is present at an academically related activity in a course by the late registration deadline.  \n  \nPresence includes, but is not limited to:  \n\n    1. Physically attending a class where there is an opportunity for direct interaction between the instructor and students;\n  \n\n    2. Submitting an academic assignment;\n  \n\n    3. Taking an exam, an interactive tutorial, or computer-assisted instruction;\n  \n\n    4. Attending a study group that is assigned by the institution;\n  \n\n    5. Participating in an online discussion about academic matters; and\n  \n\n    6. Initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question about the academic subject studied in the course; and\n  \nPresence does not include activities where a student may be present, but not\nacademically engaged, such as\u2014  \n\n    1. Living in institutional housing;\n  \n\n    2. Participating in the institution's meal plan;\n  \n\n    3. Logging into an online class without active participation; or\n  \n\n    4. Participating in academic counseling or advisement.\n  \nA determination of \u201cacademic attendance\u201d or \u201cattendance at an academically-\nrelated activity\u201d must be made by the institution; a student's certification\nof attendance that is not supported by institutional documentation is not\nacceptable.  \n  \n\n  2. Delinquent Financial Obligation - Past due on a financial obligation of the University of Hawai\u2018i, or failing to pay for tuition and fees by a published deadline (AP 8.621).\n\n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nAttendance and class participation are both a privilege and an obligation.\nThey are factors that promote college success. Students are expected to\nestablish initial attendance and maintain consistent attendance and\nparticipate in the courses for which they are registered.  \n  \nSome students within the UH System enroll in classes, have tuition and fees\npayment balances, but fail to follow through with course attendance and\ncompletion (\u201cno show\u201d). Currently, these students accrue a bill based on\nregistration, regardless of attendance. This financial obligation can prevent\nthem from further enrollment when they are ready to succeed. Moreover, this\nprocess creates a burden of collection on the College\u2019s business office and is\na risk regarding institutional compliance.  \n  \nThis policy functions to underscore the importance of the first days as a\nfoundation for semester success, to prevent unnecessary financial obligations\nfor students who have not reaped educational benefit due to nonattendance in a\ncourse, and to keep the institution in compliance with Federal Title IV\nfunding rules and regulations.  \n  \nUnder this policy, students who fail to establish attendance and participation\nin class by the end of the late registration period (\u201cno show\u201d) are dropped\nfrom the class. Tuition and fees charges for the class will be deleted from\nthe student\u2019s account and, if applicable, the student\u2019s financial aid or\nveteran\u2019s benefits will be recalculated accordingly. The class will be erased\nfrom the transcript and no grade will be assigned.  \n  \nIn order to implement this policy, all faculty members must verify initial\nparticipation of students registered in their courses by the end of the late\nregistration period for that term. Faculty members teaching online, hybrid, or\nother classes that do not meet face-to-face during the late registration\nperiod will verify initial attendance through one of the following ways:  \n  \n\n  1. Submission of an academic assignment\n  \n\n  2. Completion of an assessment\n  \n\n  3. Participation in an online discussion board about academic-related topics\n  \n\n  4. Completion of a trackable interaction within the learning system\n  \n\n  5. Email the faculty member about a course-related subject\n  \n\n  6. Other academically-related activity defined by the faculty member that meets federal guidelines for establishing initial attendance.\n\n  \nA student is responsible for informing the faculty member if he/she will be\nabsent during the late registration period and wishes to stay enrolled.  \n  \nA student who is dropped from a course via this policy may request a\nreinstatement in the course through the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs\n(VCAA) to add back a dropped course with instructor permission. Late fees may\napply. Students who are reinstated are responsible for any missed work.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThere is no policy-specific delegation of authority.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nTo establish policy on student and credit transfer within the university.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. The university, as a comprehensive state-wide system, offers instruction in\na wide variety of programs throughout the state. As a unified system of\npostsecondary education, it is important that the maximum degree of\ncoordination and cooperation exists among campus instructional units in order\nto ensure the efficient utilization of available resources. This coordination\nand cooperation can offer wide opportunities to residents of Hawai\u2018i by\npermitting them to start their education at one campus and, through productive\nstudy in a planned program, succeed in achieving their educational objective\nby graduating from another campus.  \n  \nB. It is the policy of the board that those students who can benefit from\ntransfer and who desire to meet their educational goals by transfer are\nassisted through appropriate counseling and advising, and efficient student\nand course transfer procedures. The transfer experience should be made as\nsimple and predictive as possible. Unreasonable institutional barriers to\ntransfer should be eliminated.  \n  \nC. All university and campus policies and practices affecting student and\ncourse transfer shall be periodically reviewed to ensure that they are:  \n  \n1\\. Founded on sound academic principles; and  \n  \n2\\. Designed and implemented in a manner which facilitates the smooth flow of\nstudents towards successful completion of their postsecondary educational\ngoals.  \n  \nD. Reports on the status of student and credit transfer within the University\nof Hawai\u2018i will be provided upon request by the board.  \n\n##  IV.

Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines relating to the\nSystemwide Student Conduct Code, including standards for the ways in which\nmembers of the University of Hawai\u2019i (UH) community interact with each other\nin the pursuit of both academic excellence and social responsibility.  \n  \nThe Systemwide Student Conduct Code is neither a criminal nor a civil code and\ndoes not operate like one. UH\u2019s expectations for our fellow community members\nare for a significantly higher standard of conduct than the bare minimum\nprescribed by law; conduct that is legal may nevertheless still be\nunacceptable within the bounds of our UH community.  \n  \nThe policies set forth in this code are intended to serve primarily as an\nextension of UH\u2019s educational mission -- to guide students in their growth as\nmembers of the UH and broader communities.  \n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\n  1. Registered Independent Organization (RIO) refers to a student organization, association, or club that has been formed to meet special interests of certain groups of students on campus. \n  \n\n  2. Reporting Party refers to any person who submits an alleging that a student violated this Student Conduct Code. When a student believes that s/he has been a victim of another student\u2019s misconduct, the student who believes s/he has been a victim will have the same recourse under this Student Conduct Code as are provided to the Reporting Party, even if another member of the UH community submitted the charge.\n  \n\n  3. Responding Party refers to any student (defined under this policy) accused of violating this Student Conduct Code. \n  \n\n  4. Senior Student Affairs Officer means the campus administrator (i.e., dean or vice chancellor or designee) who is in charge of the division of student affairs, and generally charged by the campus Chancellor to be responsible for the administration of the Student Conduct Code.\n  \n\n  5. Student means all persons registered in courses at UH, either full-time or part-time, pursuing undergraduate or graduate studies. In addition, for purposes of this Student Conduct Code only, this Code also applies to: (1) students who have been suspended or dismissed, students who withdraw after allegedly violating the Student Conduct Code and may return to UH, students who are on a leave of absence from UH, or students who are on medical leave; and (2) persons who (a) have been notified of their admission **_and_** (b) have registered or officially participated in orientation or other officially recognized UH activities.1\n  \n\n  6. Student Conduct Administrator means a UH official authorized on a case-by-case basis by the Senior Student Affairs Officer to impose sanctions upon any student(s) found to have violated the Student Conduct Code. The Senior Student Affairs Officer may authorize a Student Conduct Administrator to serve simultaneously as a Student Conduct Administrator and the sole member or one of the members of the Student Conduct Board. The Senior Student Affairs Officer may authorize the same Student Conduct Administrator to impose sanctions in all cases.\n  \n\n  7. Student Conduct Board means any person or persons authorized by the Senior Student Affairs Officer to determine whether a student has violated the Student Conduct Code and to recommend sanctions that may be imposed when a rules violation has been committed.\n  \n\n  8. UH encompasses any campus or site within the University of Hawai\u2019i system.\n  \n\n  9. UH community member includes any person who is a student, faculty member, UH official or any other person employed by UH. A person\u2019s status in a particular situation shall be determined by the Senior Student Affairs Officer.\n  \n\n  10. UH official includes any person employed by UH, performing assigned administrative or professional responsibilities.\n  \n\n  11. UH premises include all land, buildings, facilities, and other property in the possession of or owned, used, or controlled by UH (including adjacent streets and sidewalks). \n  \n\n  12. The term \"shall\" is used in the imperative sense.\n  \n\n  13. The term \"may\" is used in the permissive sense. \n\n  \n  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n  1. Introduction\n  \n\n    1. The purposes of UH are to give thorough instruction, conduct research and disseminate knowledge in and of branches of advanced learning as prescribed by its Board of Regents. UH is committed to ensuring a safe, civil, learning and working environment in which the dignity of every individual is respected. All members of the UH community - students, faculty and staff - share responsibility for its growth and continued welfare.\n  \n\n    2. Choosing to join the UH community obligates each student to abide by this code of conduct. As members of the UH community, students accept the responsibility to become fully acquainted with UH\u2019s rules and to comply with UH\u2019s authority. UH expects students to maintain standards of personal integrity that are in harmony with the educational goals of UH; to respect the rights, privileges, and property of others; and to observe national, state, and local laws and University policies and procedures.\n  \n\n    3. UH views the disciplinary process as a learning experience which aims to promote growth and understanding of one\u2019s responsibilities and privileges within the UH environment. To this end, the disciplinary process attempts to balance an understanding and knowledge of students and their needs with the needs of the academic community. Pursuit of a college education provides an opportunity for exploration of new ideas, experimentation, self-examination, formation of new relationships, and development of ideals and direction. However, UH does not absolve students from accepting responsibility for their behavior in their pursuit of a college education. Rather, it reaffirms the principle of student freedom that is coupled with an acceptance of responsibility for one\u2019s actions and the consequences of such actions.\n  \n\n  2. Student Conduct Code Authority\n  \n\n    1. This Student Conduct Code applies at all locations of UH, including any affiliated residence hall.\n  \n\n    2. The Student Conduct Administrator shall determine the composition of Student Conduct Boards and Appellate Boards and determine which Student Conduct Board, Student Conduct Administrator and Appellate Board shall be authorized to hear each matter.\n  \n\n    3. The Senior Student Affairs Officer shall develop policies for the administration of the student conduct system and procedural rules for the conduct of Student Conduct Board Hearings that are not inconsistent with provisions of the Student Conduct Code.\n  \n\n    4. Decisions made by a Student Conduct Board and/or Student Conduct Administrator shall be final, pending the appeal process.\n  \n\n    5. At the Student Conduct Board Hearing and for purposes of any appeal, the technical rules of evidence applicable to civil and criminal cases shall not apply.\n\n  \n  \n\n##  IV. Proscribed Conduct\n\n  1. Jurisdiction of the UH Student Conduct Code  \n\n    1. On University property; or\n  \n\n    2. Outside of University property if:\n  \n\n      1. the conduct was in connection with a University-sponsored program or activity; or\n  \n\n      2. the conduct may have a continuing adverse effect or could create a hostile environment on campus.  \n  \nThe Senior Student Affairs Officer shall decide whether the Student Conduct\nCode shall be applied to conduct occurring off campus (including but not\nlimited to the use of social media and other electronic forums), on a case-by-\ncase basis, in their sole discretion.\n\n  \n\n  2. Conduct \u2013 Rules and Standards  \nThe following are examples of the types of behavior that conflict with the\ncommunity standards that UH values and expects of students. Engaging in, or\nattempting to engage in any of these behaviors subjects a student to the\ndisciplinary process and sanctions on each campus.  \n\n    1. Acts of dishonesty, including but not limited to the following:\n  \n\n      1.

The express or implied consent of the victim will not be a defense. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing is not a neutral act; both are violations of this rule.\n  \n\n    10. Failure to comply with any directions of UH officials or law enforcement officers acting in performance of their duties and/or failure to provide identification to these persons when requested to do so.\n  \n\n    11.

Attempting to influence the impartiality of a Student Conduct Administrator, UH official, or Student Conduct Board prior to, and/or during the course of, the Student Conduct Code System or other related UH processes.   \n\n      6. Harassment (verbal or physical) and/or intimidation of a Student Conduct Administrator, UH official, or Student Conduct Board prior to, and/or during the course of, the Student Conduct Code System or other related UH processes.  \n\n      7. Failure to comply with imposed sanction(s).  \n\n      8. Influencing or attempting to influence another person to commit an abuse of the Student Conduct Code System or other related UH processes.\n  \n\n    24. Retaliation. UH prohibits and will not tolerate retaliation as defined in EP 7.205. Retaliation is adverse actions taken against a person because of their good faith participation in the following types of protected activities:  \n\n      1. Seeking advice or assistance about a Student Conduct Code or systemwide sanction concern;  \n\n      2. Opposing or filing an informal or formal complaint regarding an alleged violation of this policy;  \n\n      3. Testifying, assisting, or participating in an investigation or other proceeding related to an alleged violation of this policy.\n  \nAdverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from\nmaking or supporting a complaint under this policy. A retaliation complaint,\nallegation, or report will be reviewed as a separate offense under this\npolicy; that is, a student can be found responsible for retaliation even if\nnot found to be responsible for the underlying reported Student Conduct Code\nviolation.  \n  \nAdditionally, UH prohibits and does not tolerate retaliation as defined in EP\n1.204.  \n\n  \n\n    25. Violation of Residence Hall Rules and/or Policies: Violation of residence hall rules and/or policies where the violation also involves some aspect of this Student Conduct Code, may subject the student to disciplinary procedures under this Student Conduct Code.\n  \n\n  3. Violation of Law and UH Discipline  \n\n    1. UH disciplinary proceedings may be instituted against a student charged with conduct that potentially violates both the criminal law and this Student Conduct Code (that is, if both possible violations result from the same factual situation) without regard to the pendency of civil or criminal litigation in court or criminal arrest and prosecution. Proceedings under this Student Conduct Code may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings at the discretion of the Senior Student Affairs Officer. Determinations made or sanctions imposed under this Student Conduct Code shall not be subject to change because criminal charges arising out of the same facts giving rise to violation of University rules were dismissed, reduced, or resolved in favor of or against the criminal law defendant.\n  \n\n    2. When a student is charged by federal, state, or local authorities with a violation of law, UH will not request or agree to special consideration for that individual because of their status as a student. If the alleged offense is also being processed under the Student Conduct Code, UH may advise off-campus authorities of the existence of the Student Conduct Code and of how such matters are typically handled within the UH community. UH may cooperate with law enforcement and other agencies in the enforcement of criminal law on campus and in the conditions imposed by criminal courts for the rehabilitation of student violators (provided that the conditions do not conflict with campus rules or sanctions). In the event of law enforcement and/or government agency enforcement of laws and regulations, UH may, as appropriate, adjust any Student Conduct Code investigation and/or proceeding so as not to interfere or unduly prejudice the law enforcement process. Individual students and other members of the UH community, acting in their personal capacities, remain free to interact with governmental representatives as they deem appropriate. \n\n  \n  \n\n##  V. Delegation of Authority\n\nAuthority to hear and decide on whether or not alleged violations of the\nStudent Conduct Code have occurred as well as to determine subsequent\ndisciplinary sanctions is delegated to senior student affairs officers,\nstudent conduct officers, or student conduct boards as described in this\npolicy.  \n  \n\n##  VI.

Seeking advice or assistance about a student conduct code or systemwide sanction concern;\n  \n\n  2. Opposing or filing an informal or formal complaint regarding an alleged violation of this policy;\n  \n\n  3. Testifying, assisting, or participating in an investigation or other proceeding related to an alleged violation of this policy.\n\n  \nAdverse actions are actions that would dissuade a reasonable person from\nmaking or supporting a complaint under this policy.  \n  \nExamples of adverse actions that might constitute retaliation include  \ndirect or implied threats, coercion, harassment, intimidation, or\nencouragement of others to retaliate, in addition to a significant change in\none\u2019s status, such as suspension, unsatisfactory or unfair evaluations, unfair\ngrades, unfair assignments, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with\nsignificantly different responsibility or a decision causing a significant\nchange in benefits.  \n  \nA retaliation complaint, allegation, or report will be reviewed as a separate\noffense under this policy; that is, a student can be found responsible for\nretaliation even if not found to be responsible for the underlying reported\nstudent conduct code violation or systemwide sanction request.  \n  \n\n##  IV.

This is a new procedure.  \nResponsible Office: Office of the Vice President for Budget and Finance/Chief\nFinancial Officer  \nGoverning Board and/or Executive Policy: EP 1.102, Authority to Manage and\nControl the Operations of the Campus  \nReview Date: August 2018  \n\n##  I. Purpose\n\nTo address the tax treatment of financial assistance provided to/for\nindividuals who are not required to perform services in exchange for the\nfinancial assistance they receive, and who are not regular employees.  \n  \nNon-Service Financial Assistance (NSFA) is generally considered income by the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS), unless an Internal Revenue Code or tax treaty\nexemption can be applied. Scholarships and fellowships are the most common\nform of NSFA at educational institutions, and may consist of tuition waivers,\nas well as payments for fees, room, board, and many other types of expenses,\nincluding travel costs.  \n  \nAll scholarship and fellowship payments made to or on behalf of University of\nHawai\u2018i (UH) students must be processed through UH.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. Fellowship is defined as an amount paid for the benefit of an individual to\naid in the pursuit of study or research. An example of a fellowship is a\nstipend awarded to a post-doctoral fellow for the purpose of aiding the post-\ndoctoral fellow\u2019s research.  \n  \nB. General Program Expense is defined as any costs supporting activities of\neducating or instructing students for imparting knowledge or skill that\nfulfills the purpose of the academic program.  \n  \nC. General Welfare Exclusion (GWE) is a terminology that the IRS has accepted\nto exempt gross income from individuals who received payments under\ngovernmentally provided social benefit programs for the promotion of the\ngeneral welfare. To qualify for this exclusion, the payments must: (1) be made\nto individuals; (2) be made from a governmental fund; (3) be for the promotion\nof the general welfare, based on need \u2013i.e., individual or family need; and\n(4) not represent compensation for services.  \n  \nD. Nonresident Alien is defined as any individual from a foreign country who\nis not a permanent resident or a resident alien.  \n  \nE. Permanent Resident Alien is defined as a lawful permanent resident of the\nUnited States at any time if the person has been given the privilege,\naccording to the immigration laws, of residing permanently in the United\nStates as an immigrant. The person generally has this status if the U.S.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (or its predecessor organization)\nhas issued an alien registration card, also known as a \u201cgreen card.\u201d The\nperson continues to have resident status under this test unless the status is\ntaken away or is administratively or judicially determined to have been\nabandoned.  \n  \nF. Resident Alien is defined as a status a foreign person attained by\nobtaining permanent resident status as defined earlier or being physically\npresent in the United States for a specified time under the substantial\npresence test as prescribed by the IRS. Under the IRS rules, to meet the\nsubstantial presence test, an individual must be physically present in the\nUnited States for at least: (1) 31 days during the current calendar year, and\n(2) 183 days during the 3 year period that includes the current year and each\nof the two years before the current year. Individuals with F-1 visa status\nwill be exempt from the substantial presence test for the first five years and\nJ-1 visa status individuals will be exempt for the first 2 years in the\npreceding 6 calendar years.  \n  \nG. Scholarship is defined as an amount paid or allowed to, or for the benefit\nof, a student (whether a primary/secondary school student, undergraduate, or\ngraduate) at an educational institution to aid in the pursuit of his or her\nstudies. An example of a scholarship is the UH Regents and Presidential\nScholarship awarded to outstanding UH undergraduate students. This scholarship\nprovides a four-year tuition waiver, a $4,000 allowance, and one-time travel\ngrant of $2,000.  \n  \nH. Stipend is defined as a fixed sum of money paid periodically for services\nor to defray expenses. A stipend may include, but is not limited to,\nscholarship, fellowship, honorarium, prize, awards, etc. As a result, tax\ntreatment may differ based on the purpose of the stipend payment.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Scholarship and Fellowship Payments to UH Students  \n  \n1\\. All scholarship and fellowship payments made to or on behalf of UH\nstudents must be processed through UH as described below:  \n  \na. U.S. Citizens, Permanent Resident Aliens, and Resident Alien Students \u2013 All\nscholarship and fellowship payments for qualified educational expenses paid to\na U.S. citizen, permanent resident alien, or resident alien student enrolled\nat the University of Hawai\u2018i, shall be processed through the Banner student\ninformation system (Banner). However, payments for non-qualified scholarship\nand fellowship to UH students shall be processed either by the UH Casher\u2019s\nOffice through Banner or by the UH Disbursing Office through the Kuali\nFinancial System (KFS).  \n  \nb. Nonresident Alien Students \u2013 Similarly, all qualified education expenses\nshould be processed through the Banner student information system. Non-\nqualified scholarship and fellowship payments paid to nonresident alien\nstudents enrolled at the University of Hawai\u2018i shall be processed by the UH\nDisbursing Office through KFS, to comply with tax withholding and reporting\nrequirements.  \n  \nc. All scholarship and fellowship payments shall be disclosed to the student\npayee\u2019s home campus Financial Aid Office as required by federal Title IV\nregulations.  \n  \nExamples of situations that do not qualify as a scholarship or fellowship:  \n  \n\\- A payment for services is not considered a scholarship or fellowship. If\npayment is contingent on services being performed, the payment cannot be\nclassified as a scholarship or fellowship.  \n  \n\\- General program expenses incurred by a scholarship or fellowship program\nthat do not benefit a specific individual (such as beverages provided at an\ninformational community meeting or a bus/transportation service that is open\nto any participant) are not considered part of an individual\nscholarship/fellowship. However, if the expense is to support a specific\nrecipient (such as payments for an airline ticket or lodging), the expense is\nlikely a scholarship/fellowship (provided all other scholarship/fellowship\nrequirements are met) unless the activity resulting in the expense is part of\nan official UH course curriculum, the activity is specifically described in\nthe class catalog, or UH Chartered Student Organization. Please see FAQs\nposted on Financial Management Office \u2013 Tax Services website for examples.  \n  \nB. Qualified and Non-Qualified Scholarships/Fellowships  \n  \n1\\. Qualified Scholarships/Fellowships  \n  \na. A qualified scholarship is not considered income to a recipient, and no\nreporting or withholding is required. A scholarship and/or fellowship are\nconsidered \u201cqualified\u201d if the following conditions are met:  \n  \n(1) The recipient must be a candidate for a degree at an educational\ninstitution that maintains a regular faculty and curriculum, and normally has\na regularly enrolled body of students in attendance at the place where it\ncarries on its educational activities (this includes students who attend a\nprimary or secondary school or are pursuing a degree at a college or\nuniversity);  \n  \n(2) The scholarship or fellowship must be for the purpose of conducting study\nor research at an educational institution; and  \n  \n(3) The scholarship or fellowship must be used for tuition, fees, books,\nsupplies, and equipment required for enrollment or attendance at the\neducational institution (i.e., required for all students in the course at the\neducational institution).  \n  \n2\\. Non-Qualified Scholarships/Fellowships  \n  \na. A non-qualified scholarship/fellowship is considered income, but is only\nreportable (and possibly withholdable) by UH for nonresident aliens.\nAccountable plan rules may not be applied to exclude income from any expense\npayments (including travel expenses) that qualify as scholarship/fellowship.\nThus, all non-qualified scholarship/ fellowship travel expense payments are\nconsidered income regardless of substantiation.  \n  \nb. A scholarship and/or fellowship is considered \u201cnon-qualified\u201d if it does\nnot meet the definition of a qualified scholarship or fellowship. Non-\nqualified scholarships/fellowships are often provided for room, board, and\nother types of expenses, such as travel costs.  \n  \n\\- An example of a non-qualified scholarship payment is the $4,000 allowance\n(unless the allowance is used for tuition or other qualified expenses) and\n$2,000 travel grant provided by the UH Regents and Presidential Scholarship\ndiscussed in Section II.G., above. Other examples of non-qualified scholarship\npayments may include the assistance provided by programs such as TRIO, Upward\nBound, Talent Search, and GEAR UP, that provide counseling and tutoring\nservices, travel expenses, etc., to eligible high school students.  \n  \nC. Tax Residency Determination \u2013 The tax treatment of a non-qualified\nscholarship/fellowship payment is governed by different sections of the\nInternal Revenue Service Code, depending on whether a recipient is a U.S.\ncitizen, permanent resident alien, resident alien, or nonresident alien. This\nnecessitates the need to determine the tax residency of individuals who are\nnot U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens, by having the individual\ncomplete the Substantial Presence Test (SPT) on the UH Form WH-1. If an\nindividual passes the SPT, he/she is categorized as a resident alien and may\nbe treated in the same manner as a U.S. citizen or permanent resident alien.\nIf an individual does not pass the SPT, he/she is categorized as a nonresident\nalien.  \n  \nD. Tax Treatment of Qualified Scholarships/Fellowships \u2013 U.S. Citizens,\nPermanent Resident Aliens, Resident Aliens and Nonresident Aliens  \n  \n1\\. Qualified scholarship/fellowship payments are excluded from a recipient\u2019s\nincome. There is no requirement for reporting on an IRS Form 1099-Misc or IRS\nForm 1042-S, and no withholding is required for nonresident aliens.  \n  \n\\- An example of a qualified scholarship is the tuition waiver provided by the\nUH Regents and Presidential Scholarship discussed in Section II.G., above.  \n  \nE. Tax Treatment of Non-Qualified Scholarships/Fellowships \u2013 U.S. Citizens,\nPermanent Resident Aliens and Resident Aliens  \n  \n1\\. Non-qualified scholarship/fellowship payments are not required to be\nreported on an IRS Form 1099-Misc. However, programs are responsible for\nresponding to any scholarship/fellowship recipient inquiries regarding the\namount of financial assistance provided to the recipient. When\nwelcome/informational letters are first sent to recipients informing them of\ntheir financial assistance, it is recommended that the letters include\nlanguage similar to the following: \u201cIf you require financial information\nregarding the financial assistance and/or benefits you will be receiving,\nplease contact [insert name of appropriate program personnel].\u201d Programs\n(respective departments) at UH are responsible for responding to any\nscholarship/fellowship recipient inquiries regarding the amount of financial\nassistance provided to the recipient.  \n  \n2\\. A disbursement voucher (DV) should be processed through KFS to pay an\nindividual for non-qualified scholarships/fellowships.  \n  \n3\\. If payment to a recipient is impractical and a third-party payment method\nis used instead, financial assistance information for each individual\nrecipient will not be available in the UH payment records. A third-party\npayment is any payment that is not paid directly to a recipient, such as when:\n(1) a cash advance is given to a principal investigator or other authorized\nemployee who in turn pays recipients cash or provides recipients with services\nor goods, or (2) a vendor is paid to provide services/goods (such as airline\ntickets, accommodations, food, gift cards, etc.) to recipients. In order for\nprograms to respond to recipients\u2019 requests for information, it is recommended\nthat the amounts paid on behalf of each recipient be tracked. An example of a\nspreadsheet template can be requested through Financial Management Office \u2013\nTax Management. If a program chooses not to track the amounts actually\nprovided to each recipient, the program will still be responsible for\nproviding recipients with this information if requested.  \n  \n4\\. Certain types of non-qualified scholarship/fellowship payments may be\nexcluded from a recipient\u2019s income. If a program believes that certain\npayments may qualify under the General Welfare Exclusion (GWE) (or other\napplicable exclusion), the program may inform the recipient about the GWE and\nsuggest that he/she consult with his/her own tax advisor to determine whether\nthe exclusion is applicable. The ability to apply the GWE depends on a\nrecipient\u2019s individual financial circumstances.  \n  \nF. Tax Treatment of Non-Qualified Scholarships/Fellowships \u2013 Nonresident\nAliens  \n  \n1\\. Non-qualified scholarship/fellowship payments that are U.S. source income\n(meaning that the payment is made for an activity that occurs in the U.S.) may\nbe subject to tax withholding, and must be reported on an IRS Form 1042-S\nregardless of the amount paid or whether the tax withholding rate is reduced\nor eliminated.  \n  \n2\\. A disbursement voucher (DV) should be processed through KFS to pay an\nindividual. Submit all payment requests for nonresident aliens to UH\nDisbursing for the appropriate tax reporting and/or withholding. Tax\nwithholding reduces the amount paid to an individual. For example, if 30% tax\nwithholding is required, the individual only receives 70% of the intended\npayment.  \n  \nG. Reductions/Exclusions to Tax Withholding on Non-Qualified Scholarships/\nFellowships for Nonresident Aliens  \n  \n1\\. Income Source \u2013 Only U.S. source income is subject to U.S. taxation. If UH\nmakes a payment for an activity occurring outside of the U.S., it is\nconsidered \u201cforeign source\u201d income, which is not reportable to the IRS and is\nnot subject to tax withholding.  \n  \n2\\. Visa Status \u2013 The standard statutory tax withholding rate is 30%. If the\nrecipient is a candidate for a degree on an F, J, M, or Q visa, the tax\nwithholding rate may be reduced to 14%.  \n  \n3\\. Tax Treaty \u2013 The amount of withholding may be reduced or eliminated if\nthere is an applicable tax treaty. In order for a recipient to claim a reduced\nor eliminated withholding rate, programs must obtain an IRS Form W-8BEN from\nthe recipient, and submit the form to UH Disbursing.  \n  \n4\\. If the funding source is a U.S. Agency for International Development\n(USAID) grant and the payment is for lodging or meals for a program in the\nU.S., the withholding rate can be reduced to 0%. A signed statement by the\nPrincipal Investigator, such as \u201cI certify that the [name of grant] is funded\nby USAID\u201d, must accompany the payment document.  \n  \n5\\. GWE \u2013 While the GWE for need-based programs (discussed in Section E.4,\nabove) may ultimately reduce a nonresident alien recipient\u2019s income when\nhis/her personal tax return is filed, UH cannot make a determination as to\nwhether the GWE applies, because such a determination involves recipients\u2019\nindividual financial circumstances. UH will therefore continue to report\nand/or withhold the payments on an IRS Form 1042-S.  \n  \nH. Third-Party Payments of Non-Qualified Scholarship/Fellowship for\nNonresident Aliens  \n  \n1\\. For third party payments of non-qualified scholarship/fellowship to\nnonresident aliens, the program will be responsible for:  \n  \na. Contacting the Disbursing Office, A/P Supervisor or Senior Pre-Audit Clerk\nin advance to establish a special vendor code and assist as necessary in\nprocessing the payment.  \n  \nb. Collecting and forwarding the recipient\u2019s UH WH-1 form and related\nsupporting documentation to the Disbursing Office for assessment. Upon\ncompletion, Disbursing will advise the department of the tax withholding rate\nfor the payment and grossing up the payment amount (contact Disbursing Office\nif assistance is required).  \n  \nc. Submit invoices and a summary report directly to the Disbursing Office as\nsoon as practicable to ensure timely payment of tax withholding to the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).  \n  \n(1) Summary report spreadsheet should include the following information for\neach participant:  \n  \n(a) Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial  \n  \n(b) US SSN/ITIN (if available)  \n  \n(c) Current mailing address  \n  \n(d) Pro Rata amount for the individual  \n  \n(2) The purpose of the summary report is to report each recipient\u2019s amount on\nIRS Form 1042-S at the end of the calendar year.  \n  \nd. Program responsibilities for the following third-party payment situations\nare explained below:  \n  \n(1) Cash Payment by a Program \u2013 Cash advances to Nonresident aliens are not\npermitted by the UH.  \n  \n(2) Gross Up Method and Tax Withholding on a Vendor Payment Made by UH.  \n  \n(a) The following scenarios are examples illustrating the mathematical\ncalculations for the proper grossing-up of the federal tax that is required to\nbe withheld.  \n  \n\\- Scenario 1 (30%): If $100 is due the vendor, divide $100 by 70% (.70) =\n$142.86. $142.86 is the amount the program must pay. $100 is paid to the\nvendor, and $42.86 is the \u201cwithheld tax\u201d paid to the IRS [30% of $142.86]  \n  \n\\- Scenario 2 (14%): $100 is due the vendor, divide $100 by 86% (.86) =\n$116.28. $116.28 is the amount the program must pay $100 is paid to the\nvendor, and  \n$16.28 is the \u201cwithheld tax\u201d paid to the IRS [14% of $116.28]  \n  \n(b) The tax paid to the IRS when an amount is grossed up is more than the\namount that would have been withheld on a payment made to a recipient, because\nthe total taxable amount includes the tax paid on behalf of the nonresident\nalien. For example, in the first scenario, $42.86 is more than the $30 that\nwould normally be withheld on a $100 payment, because tax must also be paid on\nthe $30 tax that is being paid for the nonresident alien.  \n  \n(c) If a single payment is made to a vendor for assistance that will be\nprovided to multiple recipients (who have different tax residency statuses\nand/or withholding rates), the gross up calculation must be performed for each\nindividual for whom the withholding is required.  \n  \nI. Tax Treatment for Scholarship and Fellowship Matrix  \n  \nRefer to AP 8.561 Attachment 1, Tax Treatment for Scholarship and Fellowship\nMatrix.  \n  \nJ. PRIZES AND AWARDS  \n  \n1\\. If a payment is based on a past accomplishment or activity or is received\nas the result of entering a contest, it is generally considered a prize or\naward, rather than a scholarship/fellowship, which is generally awarded for\nfuture or continuing educational activity (such as for future studies or\nparticipation in an educational program). A recipient of a prize or award must\ncomplete an IRS Form W-9 (U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens) or a UH\nForm WH-1 (resident aliens and nonresident aliens).  \n  \n2\\. U.S. Citizens, Permanent Resident Aliens, and Resident Aliens \u2013 A payment\nof $600 or greater from all UH campuses for the same person (or cumulative\npayments totaling $600 or greater for a calendar year) must be reported on an\nIRS Form 1099-Misc. Accountable plan rules may not be applied to travel\nexpenses that are classified as a prize or award, and all such payments are\nincluded as income on an IRS Form 1099-Misc. Merchandise or products won as a\nprize or award are reported at their fair market value, and a description and\namount must be submitted to the UH Disbursing Office along with UH Form WH-1\nwith the recipient\u2019s vendor record number, for inclusion in the recipient\u2019s\nIRS Form 1099-Misc.  \n  \n3\\. Nonresident Aliens \u2013 Payments for prizes or awards made to nonresident\naliens shall generally be withheld at a rate of 30% unless a tax treaty\napplies. The prize or award (including the value of travel expenses and\nmerchandise or products) must be reported on an IRS Form 1042-S regardless of\nthe amount. If a third-party payment is made, follow the procedures outlined\nin Section III, H, above. Appropriate information shall be submitted to UH Tax\nManagement for proper analysis and processing.  \n  \nK. MISCELLANEOUS NSFA  \n  \nAll other types of financial assistance provided to/for an individual that do\nnot require services and are not considered scholarships or fellowships will\nbe treated in the same manner as a prize or award for tax reporting and/or\nwithholding purposes.  \n  \n\\- Example: If a U.S. citizen, permanent resident alien, or resident alien\nindividual (such as post-doctoral fellows who are not classified as employees\nat UH) receive financial assistance to attend a conference, and the financial\nassistance is not classified as a business expense or non-qualified\nscholarship or fellowship, it is subject to reporting on an IRS Form 1099-Misc\nif $600 or greater. Financial assistance provided to nonresident aliens is\nsubject to reporting on an IRS Form 1042-S, and the tax must be withheld at\nthe standard statutory rate of 30% unless a tax treaty applies (third-party\nvendor payments made for nonresident aliens must be grossed up to account for\nany required tax withholding). Accountable plan rules do not apply to non-\nservice financial assistance.  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nThere is no administrative specific delegation of authority.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\n  1. To clarify the use of work/teaching/credit hour equivalencies (\u201cEquivalencies\u201d), in defining and assigning faculty work assignments and to establish the criteria for determining instructional and non-instructional equivalencies.\n  \n\n  2. To clarify the responsibilities related to the reporting of faculty work assignments and the posting of faculty members\u2019 curriculum vitae or biobibliography.\n\n  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy-specific or unique definitions apply  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n  1. Work Assignments  \n  \n\n    1. Faculty members are expected to be responsive to students; to be concerned with developing students\u2019 potential; to serve as instructors, advisors, mentors, and leaders. To carry out these responsibilities, faculty members must remain current in their respective fields of expertise, continually engage with the most effective means of teaching, and contribute to the development of the curriculum and their programs. They are also expected to attend and participate in departmental meetings and support the general functioning of the University.\n  \n  \n\n    2. The number of Equivalencies as set forth in RP 9.214 III(G) defines a faculty member\u2019s instructional responsibility and the process by which these Equivalencies will be developed by the campus/college. Because faculty work encompasses a range of responsibilities beyond teaching, including research/scholarly or creative projects, specialized educational services, professional development, and service to the department, campus, and community, Equivalencies will be used to clarify the work assignment.  \n  \n\n      1. As instruction is the highest priority of the University of Hawai\u2018i system, teaching is among the most important duties for its faculty. Unless external funding covers a faculty member\u2019s entire salary, other documented circumstances exist such as administrative assignments, or the faculty member\u2019s primary responsibilities are all non-instructional, faculty should to the extent possible teach at least one class per semester (generally 3 credit hours).\n  \n\n      2. While the awarding of Equivalencies is not automatic, Equivalencies for other modes of instruction, including but not limited to directed readings, thesis and dissertation supervision, labs, clinical practice, and other individualized instruction shall be developed according to the process in RP 9.214. These Equivalencies will be based on an appropriate measure of instructional and engagement activity (e.g., contact hours, number of students supervised, course type, etc.).\n  \n\n      3. Research/scholarly and creative works are another important function of the University. While the awarding of Equivalencies is not automatic, Equivalencies may include research, creative works and functions that may result in a reduction of teaching duties at UH M\u0101noa, UH Hilo, and UH West O\u2018ahu. These circumstances should be documented, and a list of potential research and creative works activities shall be developed according to the process in RP 9.214. When grants are received and a reduction in teaching assignment is requested, grant funding, if available, should be used to buy out teaching duties and responsibilities.\n  \n\n      4. Faculty members are expected to provide both specialized educational and community service or equivalent professional activities to the University. While the awarding of Equivalencies is not automatic, some Equivalents for service may occur. The type of specialized education and community services that may be calculated towards a reduction in teaching duties shall be developed according to the process in RP 9.214.\n  \n\n      5. Once relevant Equivalencies are developed, consistent and in accordance with campus expectations, the Department/Division Chair will determine the allocation of Equivalencies for faculty in their unit based on the teaching demands placed upon the division or department with final approval being with the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs/Vice Provost for Academic Excellence. Equivalencies may include provisions for special service assignments where a faculty member may be specifically qualified.\n  \n\n      6. While 9-month faculty at the community colleges are generally expected to teach 27 Equivalencies, service, research and creative works may replace teaching duties in certain cases. The list of possible equivalents should be furnished to faculty and for reporting purposes.\n  \n\n      7. For faculty in the Librarian (B) category, Equivalencies will align with the aspects of librarianship appropriate to each library faculty member\u2019s areas of professional responsibility, suitable for the campus mission and purpose.\n  \n  \n\n  2. Curriculum Vita or Biobibliography  \n\n    1. A curriculum vita includes, at a minimum, a summary of the faculty member\u2019s teaching, research and creative works, specialized educational and community service and other professional activities.\n  \n\n    2. Each tenured or tenure-track faculty member shall maintain and update their own curriculum vita at least every two years.\n  \n\n    3. The curriculum vita or biobibliography shall be available on a campus website accessible to the public.\n  \n\n    4. The campus administration will assist, as needed, in the posting of a faculty member\u2019s curriculum vita or biobibliography.\n  \n\n    5. The curriculum vita or biobibliography posted to comply with this policy shall not be used for evaluative purposes.\n  \n  \n\n  3. Work Assignment Reporting  \n  \nThere is a requirement to annually report to the Board of Regents on faculty\nwork assignments, which is completed using the work assignment template (WAT).\nAssignment of credit hours as reported in the WAT reflects assigned time only.\nQualitative evaluation of work performed is handled through contract renewal,\ntenure and promotion review, and periodic review processes.\n\n  \n\n##  IV. Delegation of Authority\n\nChancellors/Provost and the Vice President for Community Colleges are\ndelegated authority to develop appropriate Equivalencies in consultation with\nfaculty and in alignment with the mission and interests of their respective\ncampuses and the responsibility of publicly posting the work assignments and\nEquivalencies for every unit on a campus website accessible to the public.  \n\n##  V.

Purpose\n\nTo establish consistency in cost accounting for the University\u2019s terminal\nvacation payouts and to describe the process of terminal vacation payout and\nfringe benefit rate.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. Terminal vacation payout fringe benefit rate \u2013 A single fringe benefit rate\ncalculated as a percentage of payroll for all employees who accrue vacation,\nregardless of funding source. The rate is assessed as a portion of total\nfringe benefit costs.  \n  \nB. Terminal vacation payout \u2013 A payment for an accrued vacation balance made\nto a UH employee who is leaving the University because of termination,\nresignation, retirement, or transfer.  \n  \nC. Terminal vacation payout pool \u2013 A pool account (system wide account - SW\n4432920) to collect all vacation payout contributions resulting from the\nfringe benefit rate assessment and from which all terminal vacation payouts\nare made.  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nA. Assessment Methodology  \n  \n1\\. Only employees who accrue vacation, regardless of funding source, are\nassessed the fringe benefit rate as a portion of total fringe benefit costs\nfor contribution to the terminal vacation leave payout pool.  \n  \n2\\. For non-imposed funds (general funds, S397, selected federal funds), each\ncampus designates the imposed fund accounts to charge the vacation payout\nfringe benefit rate.  \n  \n3\\. For all other funds (not non-imposed) the vacation payout fringe benefit\nrate is charged to the same account that the employee is paid on.  \n  \n4\\. A single terminal vacation payout fringe benefit rate for the University\nis calculated, established, and monitored by Office of Research Services (ORS)\non an annual basis.  \n  \n5\\. Fringe benefit rate assessments collected in the University system wide\naccount (SW 4432920) are used to make all terminal vacation payouts.  \n  \nB. Payouts made from the vacation payout pool  \n  \n1\\. The payout pool is established to pay for the following situations:  \n  \na. Termination, resignation or retirement from a position at the University of\nHawaii (UH) with an accrued vacation balance; or  \n  \nb.

Purpose\n\nThe University is committed to providing a safe and healthy learning and\nworking environment and to promoting the health and wellbeing of the campus\ncommunity. This policy establishes system wide parameters for a healthy, safe\nand smoke-free environment for students, faculty, staff and visitors to the\nUniversity. The purpose and objective of this policy is to adhere to and\ncomply with the applicable statutory laws and mandates governing smoking\nincluding, but not limited to, Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes (HRS), Chapter 328J,\nas may be amended from time to time. The University shall comply with all\nsubsequent amendments to Chapter 328J, HRS, as applicable.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nA. \"Smoking,\" as defined in HRS Chapter 328J-1, means inhaling or exhaling the\nfumes of tobacco or any other plant material, or burning or carrying any\nlighted smoking equipment for tobacco or any other plant material.  \n  \nB. \"Tobacco product\" means any substance that contains tobacco, including, but\nnot limited to, chewing tobacco, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, snuff, smoking\ntobacco, and smokeless tobacco.  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the University to provide a safe and healthy learning and\nworking environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors. In recognition\nof the scientifically proven harms associated with exposure to environmental\ntobacco smoke, University community members have a right not to be exposed to\nsmoke- contaminated air. Our community is best served by policies that reduce\ntobacco product use initiation, reduce consumption among current users, and\nsupport cessation efforts among current users who wish to quit.  \n  \nA. Protection from Secondhand Smoke Exposure  \n  \nChancellors, in consultation with their respective campus communities, must\nselect one of the two options below for protecting faculty, staff, students\nand visitors from the effects of exposure to secondhand smoke:  \n  \n1\\. Smoking shall be prohibited in the following areas:  \n  \na. All enclosed or partially enclosed areas, including buildings and vehicles\nowned, rented, leased or operated by the University;  \n  \nb.

Within the gates of the University's outdoors sports and performing arts\nstadiums and arenas, including walkways, corridors, and seating areas; and  \n  \ng. Any area that has been designated by the person having control of the area\nas a non-smoking area and marked with a no smoking sign.  \n  \n2\\. In lieu of option 1 above, Chancellors, in consultation with their\nrespective campus communities and after meeting the obligations detailed in\nSection IV below, may elect to designate their campus as completely smoke-\nfree, meaning that smoking is prohibited entirely on premises and in all\nfacilities associated with and occupied by the respective campus.  \n  \nB. Tobacco Use Prevention Education and Support for Cessation  \n  \nUniversity administrators are encouraged to support tobacco use prevention\neducation programs that discourage the initiation of tobacco product use and\nto assist tobacco product users who are trying to quit. This shall include\nsupporting prevention and education initiatives that encourage non-use and\naddress the risks of tobacco product use, as well as programs and services\nthat include practical steps to quit using tobacco products on campus.  \n  \nEmployees seeking tobacco product cessation guidance should be encouraged to\navail themselves of the support services offered through their healthcare\nproviders (e.g. HMSA\u2019s QuitNet program or Kaiser Permanente\u2019s HealthMedia\nBreathe programs) and/or to the State Department of Health\u2019s Tobacco Quitline.\nSupervisors are encouraged to approve an employee\u2019s request for authorized\nleave to participate in smoking cessation programs, if necessary.  \n  \nC.

Ashtrays and other cigarette butt receptacles shall be\nremoved from non-smoking areas or relocated to areas where smoking is\npermitted.  \n  \nE. Complaint Procedure  \n  \nThis policy applies to the entire university community, including faculty,\nstaff, students and visitors. While it relies on the thoughtfulness,\nconsideration and cooperation of smokers and non-smokers and will not be\nenforced through disciplinary measures, other University policies and State\nlaws and rules may be applicable.  \n  \nThe Vice President for Administration shall be responsible for policy\nimplementation and compliance in collaboration with chancellors. Questions,\ncomments, or complaints relating to this policy and/or its implementation\nshould be directed to each respective chancellor or designee. Members of the\ncampus community may voluntarily report alleged violations of this policy to\nthe respective chancellor or designee or to campus security.  \n  \nIn lieu of adverse personnel actions, violations of this policy shall be\naddressed through appropriate education and, if necessary, through local law\nenforcement in accordance with \u00a7328J-11, HRS. Violators may be subject to\nfines and penalties in accordance with \u00a7328J-12, HRS.  \n\n##  IV.

Relevant Policy  \n  \n1\\. Board policy, RP 6.203, states:  \nEvery effort will be made to provide advance notice of tuition increases.  \n  \n2\\. State Statute:  \nAct 251, adopted by the 1996 Legislature and approved by the Governor on\n6/18/96, amends Hawai\u2018i Revised Statutes as summarized below.  \n  \na. When establishing resident and non-resident tuition at the University of\nHawai\u2018i, the Board of Regents is exempt from the public notice, public\nhearing, and gubernatorial approval requirements of Chapter 91.  \n  \nb. Resident and non-resident tuition may be established at an open public\nBoard of Regents meeting subject to the requirements of the \u201cSunshine Law\u201d\n(Chapter 92), provided that:  \n  \n(1) This open meeting is held during or prior to the semester preceding the\nsemester to which the tuition applies; and  \n  \n(2) A copy of the schedule of resident tuition and the non-resident\ndifferential is filed in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor prior to taking\neffect.  \n  \n3\\. Act 251 also specifies that the Board\u2019s approval of any increase or\ndecrease in tuition for regular credit courses shall be preceded by an open\npublic meeting held during or prior to the semester preceding the semester to\nwhich the tuition applies.  \n  \nC. Tuition-Setting Procedures  \nIn accordance with the policy requirements summarized above, University\nprocedures for setting tuition are as follows.  \n  \n1\\.

The tuition proposal is distributed in written format and made available\nas follows: electronically via an appropriate information network and\ntechnology (e.g., on the Internet via the World Wide Web); to the Board of\nRegents; to the University community, including administrators, student\ngovernment leaders, campus faculty senate leaders, and collective bargaining\nunit leaders; and to others in the community as appropriate. This distribution\nincludes a request for written comments on the proposal and takes place at\nleast 15 days in advance of the open public meetings called for in III.D\nbelow.  \n  \n3\\. The administration is available to brief students and others on the\ntuition proposal.  \n  \n4\\. The administration conducts open public meeting(s) on the tuition\nproposal. For tuition proposals affecting undergraduate students, at least one\nsuch meeting is held on Hawai\u2018i, Maui, Kaua\u2018i, and O\u2018ahu. Tuition proposals\naffecting other student populations are accompanied by public meetings as\nappropriate, but in all cases at least one public meeting will be held. Public\ntuition meetings are announced on all campuses at least 15 days in advance.\nMeeting notices are disseminated via campus newspapers or other appropriate\nmeans. These public meetings take place on campuses and are scheduled outside\nof vacation days and test week. They are held for the purposes of:  \n  \na. Explaining the tuition proposal to affected students (electronic media may\nbe used to assist with this process); and  \n  \nb. Affording affected students and other interested parties the opportunity to\npresent testimony on the tuition proposal. Members of the administration are\npresent to receive testimony, and the Board is invited to attend.  \n  \n5\\.

Purpose\n\nTo establish a policy on university centers and its purpose.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nNo policy specific or unique definitions apply.  \n\n##  III. Board of Regents Policy\n\nA. University centers establish a permanent university presence in communities\nthat otherwise lack access to programs offered on university campuses. Their\nprimary purpose is instructional, with some related student support. Courses\nand programs delivered through university centers use a variety of strategies\nranging from technology intensive to face-to-face classroom interaction by\ninstructors who travel from originating campuses to a university center.  \n  \n1\\. University centers are not separately accredited; their program or degree\nofferings derive accredited status because they are provided by accredited\nuniversity campuses. Qualified students who are unable to travel to a\nuniversity campus can enroll through the centers in courses or programs\noffered by one or more of the university\u2019s accredited institutions.  \n  \n2\\. Board action shall be required to establish a university center. Three\nuniversity centers are formally recognized as part of the university:  \n  \na. University Center, Kaua\u2018i, L\u012bhu\u2018e, Kaua\u2018i, (administratively assigned to\nKaua\u2018i Community College)  \n  \nb.

University Center, West Hawai\u2018i, Kealakekua, Hawai\u2018i (administratively\nassigned to Hawai\u2018i Community College)  \n  \nB. It is the responsibility of the executive vice president for academic\naffairs/provost to periodically convene the centers, campuses, and system\noffices to coordinate programs that meet systemwide and statewide needs\neffectively and to establish overall policies and practices for the university\nnetwork of centers.  \n  \n1\\. Campuses with administrative responsibility for university centers are\nresponsible for ensuring that basic community needs assessments take place and\nthat infrastructure needs consistent with accreditation requirements are met.  \n  \n2\\. Campuses that originate educational programs and courses delivered at\nuniversity centers are responsible for the overall quality of courses/programs\noffered, including adherence to appropriate academic policies, procedures, and\naccreditation requirements.

Purpose\n\nThe purpose of EP 5.209 is to carry out the intent of the Board of Regents\u2019\npolicy to make the student transfer experience simple and predictable (Board\nof Regents Policy RP 5.214).  \n  \nThis policy provides the guidelines for transfer within the University of\nHawai`i (UH) system, including (1) the principles and assumptions underlying\nthe policy, (2) the transfer and applicability of academic credit, including\nacceptance of the UH Associate in Arts degree as fulfilling UH baccalaureate\nadmission and general education core (foundations/diversification or\nbasic/area) requirements, (3) the transfer of students, (4) articulation of\ncourses and programs, (5) lead responsibilities, and (6) related policy\nissues.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nTransfer \u2013 the process of moving academic credits from a program at one\npostsecondary institution to a program at another. Students may transfer\nvertically (two-year to four-year), horizontally (two- year to two-year, four-\nyear to four-year) or in reverse (four-year to two-year).  \n  \nArticulation \u2013 agreements that guide the transfer of students and typically\naddress the transfer of credit, specific courses, packages of courses, and\nrelated academic requirements.  \n  \nSelective Admissions Program \u2013 a selective admissions program is a program\nwith program-specific admissions requirements and application (e.g., minimum\nnumber of earned credits, minimum class standing, completion of specific\ncourses or tests, grade point ratio requirements, etc.).  \n  \nPinning \u2013 the process of creating a four-year degree pathway from a UH\nCommunity College to a four-year campus is called pinning, meaning that a\nstudent can \u201cpin\u201d (or indicate) their future four-year major, even while at a\nCommunity College  \n\n##  III. Executive Policy\n\n###\n\n  1. Principles and Assumptions\n    1. Planning for student success.  \n  \nCampus, college, or program curricular changes must be made under a \u201cHold\nHarmless\u201d principle. Students who maintain continuous enrollment in a program\nof study will not be required to modify their programs of study to accommodate\nchanges in academic policy and curriculum at campuses, colleges, or in\nprograms that occur during their programs of study. When conflicts or\ndiscrepancies emerge as a result of changes in the major or general education\nrequirements between when a student begins at a campus and when they declare\ntheir major (meaning the difference between the catalog year of their\nmatriculation and the catalog year of their major declaration) these issues\nwill be resolved with the best interest of the student in mind while upholding\nrequirements of the University of Hawai\u02bbi System. Provision may be made for\nmedical or other emergency exceptions to continuous enrollment by appeal to\nthe appropriate administrator at the campus involved.\n\n  \n\n    2. Functioning as a System.  \n  \nThe University of Hawai\u2018i System is a comprehensive statewide higher education\nsystem offering instruction in a variety of programs located at campuses on\neach of the major islands of the state. The University of Hawai\u2018i System is\ncommitted to functioning effectively as a system. This requires facilitating\nthe informed and transparent transfer of students who desire to move among the\nvarious campuses, colleges, and schools in the University of Hawai\u2018i System in\norder to meet their educational objectives. University of Hawai\u2018i campuses are\nrequired by Board policy to eliminate unreasonable barriers to transfer (see\nBOR Policy 5.214).\n\n  \n\n    3. Mission Differentiation.  \n  \nThe higher education needs and desires of the people of Hawai\u2018i vary\nconsiderably and the contributions the University of Hawai\u2018i campuses make\ntoward satisfying those needs and desires vary as well. The distinct\ncontributions that campuses make toward meeting the educational needs of the\nstate of Hawai\u2018i require that campuses offer courses and course selections\naligned with these functions and that they employ admission and transfer\ncriteria consistent with their distinct functions. For students wishing to\ntransfer efficiently throughout the system, effective advising and counseling\nregarding such distinctions are essential.\n\n  \n\n    4. Dynamic Academic Environment.  \n  \nAn institution\u2019s curriculum is not a static entity; as fields of study evolve,\ncourses and degree programs are refined and changed. In addition, University\nof Hawai\u2018i programs and departments maintain active assessment processes\nintended to inform curriculum management. A natural byproduct of regular\nassessment and curriculum management is an academic environment characterized\nby frequent change.\n\n  \n\n    5. Focus on Transparency.  \n  \nIn order to facilitate informed and transparent transfer of students across a\ndynamic academic system, communication among programs and departments across\nthe system must be regular and thorough. Accurate information about campus,\ncollege, degree and major requirements for each campus must be readily\naccessible to students, faculty, counselors and advisors across the system.\nLikewise, advising and counseling services on all campuses must be kept\ninformed and updated of programmatic requirements across the University of\nHawai\u2018i System. Planned curriculum changes may impact current student\u2019s course\nselection and thus it is critical that programmatic changes are made in\ndialogue with system counterparts to minimize the negative impact on students.\n\n  \n\n    6. Campus Responsibility for Curriculum.  \n  \nWithin the provisions of Board of Regents and University executive policies,\neach University of Hawai\u2018i campus has the authority and responsibility to\ndetermine its own curriculum, degree requirements, and related academic\npolicies, and to ensure the integrity of its campus-based credentials. As a\nresult, the curricula of the University of Hawai\u2018i campuses and colleges are a\nreflection of the wide variety of available programs of study and the\nknowledge, skills, interests and educational philosophy of their faculty,\nstaff, and administration.\n\n  \n\n    7. Role of Articulation.  \n  \nA primary purpose of articulation is to facilitate transfer of students and\ncredits from one campus to another to meet core, major, degree or graduation\nrequirements. Articulation policies and agreements are essential for a\nUniversity system of campuses that operates with decentralized authority over\ncurricula content and shared responsibility for academic policies. Such\npolicies and procedures assist in the smooth progression of students toward\ndegree programs in an environment of evolving curricular requirements.\nArticulation policy and practice must be implemented in a way that is fair to\nstudents and ensures ample time for notice and discussion with all University\nof Hawai\u2018i campuses prior to changes. Articulation is a complex matter and\nmust involve faculty, staff, and administration.\n\n  \n\n    8. Accreditation and Guidelines for Good Practice.  \n  \nThe University of Hawai\u2018i System and campus policies and practices for the\ntransfer of students and credits will conform to professional and regional\naccreditation standards (WSCUC, ACCJC) and, insofar as possible, will be\nconsistent with the Joint Statement on Transfer and Award of Academic Credit\nadopted by the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation (COPA), the American\nAssociation of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), and the\nAmerican Council on Education (ACE).\n\n  \n\n    9. General Education.  \n  \nGeneral education is fully articulated across the University of Hawai\u2018i\nSystem. Thus, both focus and foundation general education courses shall\ntransfer seamlessly across the system.\n\n  \n\n    10. Faculty Involvement.  \n  \nArticulation of curricula for the purposes of determining transfer credits is\nthe responsibility of the faculty. The Faculty will apply their expertise to\nthe evaluation of credits for the transfer and articulation process. Once\ninitial evaluation of transfer credits has been completed, the faculty will be\nconsulted regarding new course requests as needed.\n\n  \n\n    11. Transfer Advising.  \n  \nAppropriate and timely academic advising is essential for all students and is\nparticularly critical for students with baccalaureate degree goals who begin\ntheir careers at University of Hawai\u2018i Community Colleges. At the point a\nstudent at a University of Hawai\u2018i Community College has declared the intent\nto major with a four-year degree pathway, they should be provided with\ntransfer advising jointly between the two-year and the four-year\ncounselor/advisors to help identify the appropriate point of transfer. The\npoint of transfer may not always coincide with the granting of a two-year\ndegree.\n\n  \n\n    12. Coordination and Communication.  \nProposed changes in general education or degree requirements and other\nacademic policies at one campus, college or program which affect students\ntransferring from other University of Hawai\u2018i campuses must involve prior\nconsultation with faculty and administrators affected by the changes.\nConsultation implies timely and active discussion with all affected parties\nprior to a final decision on the proposed change and the resolution of any\npossible articulation and transfer issues that may result from the proposed\nchanges.\n\n  \n\n    13. STAR   \nSTAR is the definitive source by which campuses will determine if classified,\ndegree-seeking undergraduate students have met the degree requirements for\ngraduation.\n\n  \n\n    14. Student Responsibilities.  \nSmooth and informed transfer can only occur with the active involvement of the\nstudent. Students must be willing to avail themselves of available\ninformation. As active partners in the advising process, students are expected\nto seek out information regarding programs/majors, create an educational plan,\nand see an advisor/counselor regularly for academic advising.  \n\n  \n\n###\n\n  2. Student Transfers  \n\n    1. Upon Entry to a University of Hawai\u2018i Campus  \n  \n\n      1. Transfer of Previously Earned Credits   \n\n        1. The University of Hawai\u2018i Systemwide transfer evaluation system (TES) will be utilized at each University of Hawai\u2018i campus to guide consistent evaluation of previously earned credits into the University of Hawai\u2018i System.\n        2. Once evaluation and acceptance of credits earned at a regionally accredited non- University of Hawai\u2018i institution has been accepted by any campus, the decision will be shared with the other campuses to ensure the course aligns across both two and four year campuses. A process will be developed by a committee created to address articulation issues so that campuses coordinate decisions regarding what credits are awarded and a process for reviewing the transfer evaluation decisions. Transfer equivalency decisions will be honored by other campuses.\n        3. In the case of a disagreement assessing transfer credit, a campus may request a new review of their transfer credits. In the event of a disagreement on previously awarded or unawarded transfer equivalency decisions, the decision will be made by the University Council on Articulation.\n  \n\n      2. Establishing a pathway or declaring a major for a four-year degree   \n  \nStudents who begin at a two-year campus within the University of Hawai\u2018i\nSystem with the intent of transferring to a four-year campus and who have\ndecided upon a four-year degree pathway shall be able to identify their\nintended major in STAR and lock in their degree requirements. The process of\ncreating a four-year degree pathway is called pinning, meaning that a student\ncan \u201cpin\u201d (or indicate) their future four-year major, even while at a\nCommunity College. The intent of early declaration of four-year degree\npathways is to make the student transfer experience simple and predictable.\nSimilar to four-year students declaring a major at their home institution, the\nintent of pinning is to create equity for transfer students. Pinning does not\nequate to admission to any selective admissions program with specific criteria\nfor admission.  \n  \n\n        1. At the point a program of study is pinned, the catalog year for the four-year degree pathway is established. The student maintains that catalog year, provided that:  \n\n          1. the student maintains continuous enrollment;\n          2. and transfers within five years of pinning;\n          3. the student does not elect to graduate under a more recent catalog;\n          4. the program of study is not substantively modified by an articulation agreement;\n          5. the program of study is not a selective admissions program. \n        2. Only designated advisors or authorized faculty or staff are able to establish the pinned pathway including transfer advising. \n        3. When a student establishes a degree path, all transfer credits and general education requirements are designed to achieve the four-year degree and STAR will identify the optimal point of transfer, which may be prior to the completion of the two-year degree. In the case of transfer prior to completion of the two-year degree, the student may be eligible for reverse transfer. \n        4. Pinning at a University of Hawai\u2018i Community College does not impact the designation of a student\u2019s home campus or major.\n  \n\n      3. Academic Suspension \n        1. Students on academic suspension from a University of Hawai\u2018i campus may either sit out the semester they are suspended or attend another institution.\n        2. Students who choose to attend another accredited college or university and wish to return to the University of Hawai\u2018i must meet the admission requirements of the University of Hawai\u2018i campus to which they wish to return.\n  \n  \n\n    2. Upon transfer from one campus to another within the University of Hawai\u2018i System   \n  \n\n      1. Transfer students will be admitted to University of Hawai\u2018i M\u0101noa, Hilo and West O\u2018ahu based on the following criteria:   \n\n        1. Upon completion of requirements for admission and notification of acceptance; OR\n        2. Upon Automatic Admission. A student may be admitted automatically from a University of Hawai\u2018i Community College, upon (1) completion of an Associate in Arts (AA) degree, the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree, or the Associate in Science (AS) degree with an articulation agreement with a four-year campus, or (2) with a cumulative GPR/GPA of 2.0 or higher for students classified as a Hawai\u2018i resident for admission and tuition purposes. The AA degree affords general admission to University of Hawai\u2018i M\u0101noa, Hilo or West O\u2018ahu with junior standing, but does not provide admission into selective admissions programs, which may require satisfaction of additional admission requirements.  \n\n          1. Students who accept the automatic admission offer will be exempted from paying an application fee or completing an application for admission to the four-year campus.\n          2. The Office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and Policy monitors the Automatic Admission process.\n          3. Automatic admission is extended to a student who:  \n\n            1. has 50 credits that are 100 level and above, including credits earned or in-progress;\n            2. has greater than 12 or more institutional credits (at the student\u2019s home campus) that are 100 level and above, including earned or in progress credits;\n            3. has completed 45 of the 60 credits necessary to graduate with an AA degree, or are in their last semester at a University of Hawai\u2018i Community College.\n          4. Students who have current academic actions (suspension or dismissal) at a four-year campus are not eligible for automatic admission.\n          5. Students who have been offered automatic admission three times and have declined will not be eligible for automatic admission.  \n\n  \n\n      2. Transfer between two-year campuses or between a four-year campus in the UH System to a two-year campus requires following the procedure for changing home campus. \n  \n\n      3.

Purpose\n\nTo provide guidance on recording the accounting data necessary at fiscal year-\nend for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accepted\naccounting principles.  \n  \nDuring months one (1) through twelve (12) of the fiscal year, the University\ngenerally records revenues and expenses on a cash basis. Some revenues are\nrecorded on an accrual basis when the departments issue accounts receivable\ninvoices using the University\u2019s Accounts Receivable systems (KFS A/R and\nCGIN). For the presentation of the University\u2019s fiscal year-end financial\nstatements, however, both revenues and expenses must be recorded on the full\naccrual basis of accounting in accordance with Governmental Accounting and\nFinancial Reporting Standards. Accruals and other year-end adjustments are\nrecorded during the thirteenth (13th) month of the fiscal year.  \n\n##  II. Definitions\n\nAccrual basis - The basis of accounting under which revenues are recorded when\nearned and expenses are recorded when incurred (generally, when goods and\nservices are received but not necessarily paid).  \n\n##  III. Administrative Procedure\n\nYear-end accounting data is recorded by the departmental fiscal administrator,\ncentral offices such as the General Accounting and Loan Collection office\n(GALC) and the Office of Research Services (ORS), and by system- generated\naccounting entries.  \n  \nA. Common Transactions Recorded by Departmental Fiscal Administrators  \n  \nUse the Year-End JV Worksheets provided by GALC and attach supporting\ndocumentation showing detailed information for each journal voucher (JV).  \n  \n1\\. Unrecorded accounts receivable  \n  \nThe amount due to the University from the sale of goods or services, credit\nmemos from vendors, and reimbursements of expenditures.  \n  \na. Revenue related receivables, generated by the sale of goods and the\nproviding of services, are billed by departments. JVs must be prepared to\nrecord all unrecorded accounts receivable amounts if invoices were not\nrecorded into the financial system by the close of the twelfth (12th) month.\nThis procedure also applies to departments using the University\u2019s Accounts\nReceivable system (KFS A/R).  \n  \nb. Credit memos are notices from vendors stating the amounts owed to the\nUniversity for various reasons, including the return of goods. A credit memo\nis considered a receivable until paid by the vendor or applied at a later date\nto a subsequent invoice from the vendor.  \n  \nc. Reimbursements of expenditures (REX) are charges (expenditures) to an\naccount which are recovered in a subsequent fiscal year.  \n  \nFor general fund accounts (UH Appropriations G011 to G3xx), monies received\nfor a prior year expenditure shall lapse to the State general fund. General\nfund REXs should be recorded using the department\u2019s G000 account.  \n  \n2\\. Allowance for doubtful accounts  \n  \nThe portion of the accounts receivable that is not on the University\u2019s\nAccounts Receivable system (KFS A/R) which is estimated to be uncollectible.\nAn allowance for uncollectible accounts arises when the probability of\ncollecting on the receivable is presumed low. Six months is considered ample\ntime to exhaust departmental collection efforts. Attach supporting documents\nshowing the account code, invoice number and date, customer name, and amount.  \n  \n3\\. Unearned revenues  \n  \nRevenue collections made in the current fiscal year for services that will be\nrendered in the subsequent fiscal year (e.g. summer session tuition collected\nin June for sessions that cross fiscal years should be prorated between the\ntwo (2) fiscal years).  \n  \n4\\. Prepaid expenses  \n  \nThe amounts paid as of June 30th for goods and services which will be consumed\nor expended in the subsequent fiscal year (e.g. summer session expenses paid\nin June should be prorated between the two (2) fiscal years, or subscription\npaid in June for publications of the ensuing fiscal year, etc.).  \n  \n5\\. Merchandise/supplies inventory  \nThe cost of merchandise or supplies on hand as of June 30th. Refer to\nAdministrative Procedure AP 8.636 Supply Inventory.  \n  \n6\\. Tuition and housing waivers, scholarship discounts and allowances  \n  \nThe tuition and housing revenues for scholarship related payments and tuition\nwaivers for the fiscal year must be recorded as contra-revenues. Employee\ntuition and housing waivers must be recorded as revenues and expenses.  \n  \nB. Common Transactions Recorded by Central Offices and System-Generated\nEntries  \n  \n1\\. Accrued interest receivable  \n  \nInterest accrued as of June 30th on time certificates of deposit and\ninvestments since the last interest payment date.  \n  \n2\\. Accounts payable  \n  \nA liability for amounts owed by the University for goods or services received\nas of June 30th.  \n  \n3\\. Accrued payroll and fringe  \n  \nA liability for wages earned by employees but not paid as of June 30th (e.g.\nlagged payroll, SCOPIS, etc.).  \n  \n4\\. Accrued vacation  \n  \nA liability for vacation accumulated by employees but not paid as of June\n30th.  \n  \n5\\. Accrued ORS contracts and grants receivables  \n  \nORS contracts and grants receivable accruals record unbilled contracts and\ngrants revenue and should be generated after all related expense accruals are\nrecorded to ensure completeness.  \n  \n6\\. Allowance for doubtful accounts for KFS A/R and contracts and grants\ninvoices  \n  \nIf accounts receivable invoices are created through the University\u2019s Accounts\nReceivable systems (KFS A/R and CGIN), GALC and ORS will produce the\n\u201cAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\u201d entries.  \n  \nFor ORS project accounts, the allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of\nall receivable balances for awards with stop dates in prior fiscal years, plus\nreceivable balances, if any, for awards with stop dates in the current fiscal\nyear that have been determined to be unrecoverable.  \n  \n7\\. Non-imposed fringe  \n  \nEmployer\u2019s share of fringe costs that are absorbed by the State for General\nFunds (Gxxxxx), certain Special Funds (S397xx), Federal Work Study Programs\n(F223xx), Federal USDA Direct Appropriations (F26x & F27x), and other non-\nimposed federal programs (F230).  \n  \n8\\. Reclassification of negative accounts receivable  \n  \nNegative accounts receivable for sponsored projects are reclassified as\nadvance from sponsors.  \n  \n9\\. Elimination of internal service transactions  \n  \nInternal service funds are used to account for the financing of goods or\nservices provided by one program or department to other programs/departments\nof the University. The charge or fee is determined on a cost-reimbursement\nbasis. The internal service fund is set up primarily for the University\u2019s\nbenefit as an economic and efficient alternative to purchasing the goods or\nservices independently by each department from external vendors. The\nelimination entry would remove the \u201cdoubling\u201d up effect of expenses recorded\nby both the provider and user of the internal service. Revenues of the\nprovider would reduce the appropriate expenses such that allocated\n(reimbursed) expenses are reported only once on the University\u2019s financial\nstatements.  \n\n##  IV.
